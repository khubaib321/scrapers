"AIRFORCE MAINTENANCE AND PLANNING (hb)2010","Any air force in the world, which desires to be self sufficient in aircraft maintenance, has to have its own repair/ overhaul agencies for servicing the fleet of aircraft, aero-engines, rotables and other associated equipment; a task which requires careful advance planning and investment.  In this book, an attempt has been made to pen down the genesis of assessing spares requirement for 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th line servicing of airframes and aero-engines with particular emphasis on forecasting optimum number of repair/ overhaul arisings of air frames / aero-engines and rotables and the optimum number of repair / overhauls that should actually be undertaken so as not to inflate the inventory of serviceable assets beyond authorized limits. The theories related to assessment of optimum quanta of spares for undertaking the repair / overhaul tasks as well as first and second line servicing as also the associated terminologies have been explained lucidly.

"HISTORICAL DICTIONARY OF AIR INTELLIGENCE (hb)2010","From the moment man learned how to ascend off the ground; the strategic significance of air intelligence became apparent. This relatively new discipline?the first dedicated air reconnaissance missions were undertaken in 1870 during the siege of Paris when tethered French balloons were employed to spot enemy positions and direct artillery fire onto them?has developed at an astonishing speed. Over the past century air intelligence has moved from hazardous observation balloons to micro-circuitry  which can send pictures from a video camera mounted on a remotely-controlled vehicle the size of a hummingbird. The Historical Dictionary of Air Intelligence relates the evolving history of the rapidly advancing field of air intelligence. A chronology an introductory essay  and cross-referenced dictionary entries on the agencies agents operations equipment tradecraft and jargon of air intelligence make this reference as essential as it is fascinating.

"COASTAL ENGINEERING 2e(hb)2011","Historically, much harm has been done by well-meaning coastal engineering attempts, which seemed like good ideas on paper but which failed to allow for practical issues. For this reason, it is vital that theories and models are well grounded in practice.   This second edition brings the models and examples of practice up to date. It has expanded coverage of tsunamis and generating energy from waves to focus both on the great dangers and the great opportunities that the ocean presents to the coastal zone. With an emphasis on practice and detailed modelling, this is a thorough introduction to all aspects of coastal processes, morphology, and design of coastal defences. It describes numerous case studies to illustrate the successful application of mathematical modelling to real-world practice.

"THE VULCAN STORY (hb) 2017","The RAF's huge delta-wing Vulcan jet nuclear bomber is an enduring image of the Cold War era. One of the cornerstones of Britain's nuclear deterrent, in later years it was adapted for conventional bombing and saw active service in the Falklands War. Avro Vulcan XH558 was the first Vulcan B2 to enter service with the RAF in July 1960, and the last to fly (with the RAF Vulcan Display Flight in 1992). Since then, determined and extensively publicized efforts have been made to return XH558 to the air, recently boosted by financial support from the Heritage Lottery Fund. It is hoped that the Vulcan will return to the sky in early 2006, and commence airshow appearances. In this full-color tribute to the Avro Vulcan, aviation journalist and author Peter R. March discusses its development and provides a detailed history of XH558 and the efforts to get it airworthy once more. In some ways when the restored Vulcan XH558 takes to the skies again in 2006, it will fill the gap left by the grounding of the last Concorde.  About the Author PETER R. MARCH is an aviation author, photographer and journalist. He is the editor of the RAF and USAF Yearbooks for the RAF Benevolent Fund/Royal International Air Tattoo, a regular contributor to Aircraft Illustrated magazine, editor of Ian Allan's yearly abc Military Aircraft, and author of more than fifty books in his own right on aviation subjects.

"THE CONCORDE STORY (hb) 2017","Public interest in the Concorde story shows little sign of abating, despite the aircraft having been retired from airline service in November 2003. With British Airways' Concordes now on public display at various locations around the world, including examples at Heathrow Airport, Bristol (Filton), Yeovilton (Fleet Air Arm Museum), Weybridge (Brooklands Museum), Manchester (Museum of Science and Technology) and the Museum of Flight in Scotland (East Fortune) the time is ripe for a budget-priced pocket-sized layman's chronological account of the Concorde story that will appeal to Concorde visitors and Concorde enthusiasts alike. The Concorde Story is an attractive picture-led account with a short but authoritative text supported by a comprehensive selection of 80 colour and black and white photographs showing Concorde at all stages of its life. Peter R. March's narrative covers the background (how it came about, from drawing board to first flight); testing times (development flying and proving the aircraft); the fight for survival (political and airline problems); into service (transatlantic routes with BA and Air France); success and disaster (records, passenger appeal and tragedy in Paris); and grounded (the final year and the end of the story - or is it really?)

"100+1 PAKISTANI ARCHITECTS AND THEIR OWN HOUSES (hb)2007","This colourful and attractive book is about houses Pakistani architects have designed for themselves.  It profiles the designs of over one hundred architects, established professionals as well as young practitioners from all over the country. Presented chronologically, these houses reflect the personality, design philosophy and lifestyle of each architect. It is based on the premise that architects, while designing their own houses, are able to express themselves more effectively and without compromise to external factors. Such houses are therefore likely to be the truest possible expressions of the owner-architects abilities and attitudes.   Collectively these houses and home interiors also represent an evolving social history of urban living in Pakistan. With photos, plans and a number of short essays reflecting on the architecture scene in Pakistan, the book will be of interest for personal collection, as a gift, for libraries, and for scholars of Pakistani and South Asian architectural theory and criticism. The book's foreword is written by Arif Hasan.   Mukhtar Husain, the author, is a well-known professional practicing in Pakistan since 1973. Besides his involvement with building and planning projects, he has been teaching and writing for over thirty years.

"INDIAN HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH LANDSCAPE IN THE GLOBAL CONTEXT (hb) 2016","Nationally, mapping of intellectual impact of Indian research papers is now being used for policy making and monitoring scientific and social developments. Since citations received by a research paper is one of the major indicators of research impact, citation analysis and bibliometric methodologies provide the necessary quantitative and qualitative performance indicators. Not only individual researchers are mapped, but it also reflects institutional research profile together with impact of national/international collaborative endeavors. In tracking the citations in all domain areas for the period 1970-71 through 2012, the study has benchmarked the national research performance and outputs in all domains of knowledge. The detailed examination and mapping of intellectual impact have captured with complete clarity, the factors and patterns of scholarly networks and development of strategic collaborations at all levels. The document focuses on research-oriented work, which opens up new vistas for the research community. The present document is thus, a comprehensive undertaking of research and research systems on the state of research in India that encompass and goes beyond the compass of higher education. Covering the interest of a wide range of readers including scholars, professionals, researchers, faculty and policy makers, hopefully the volume will find its place in knowledge centres, institutions and all types of libraries.

"MY FEUDAL LORD (pb)1995","When a woman with brains and beauty from a wealthy background decides to take her fate into her own hands and challenge the restrictions of a male-oriented, conservative society, the consequences can be devastating. Born into one of Pakistan's most influential families, Tehmina Durrani was raised in the privileged milieu of Lahore high society, and educated at the same school as Benazir Bhutto. Like all women of her rank, she was expected to marry a prosperous Muslim from a respectable family, bear him many children, and lead a sheltered life of air-conditioned leisure. When she married Mustafa Khar, one of Pakistan's most eminent political figures, she continued to move in the best circles, and learned to keep up the public facade as a glamorous, cultivated wife, and mother of four children. In private, however, the story-book romance of the most talked-about couple in Pakistan rapidly turned sour. Mustafa Khar became violently possessive and pathologically jealous, and succeeded in cutting his wife off from the outside world. For the course of the fourteen-year marriage, she suffered alone, in silence.  When Tehmina decided to rebel, the price she paid was extremely high: as a Muslim woman seeking a divorce, she signed away all financial support, lost the custody of her four children, and found herself alienated from her friends and disowned by her parents. Following the divorce, she felt she had to tell her story. When Pakistan publishers balked at the controversial nature of her manuscript, she published it herself. The book was a bombshell and shook Pakistani society to its foundations. Her at last was someone who had succeeding in reconciling her faith in Islam with her ardent belief in women's rights. Tehmina's story, adapted now for western readers, provides extraordinary insights into the vulnerable position of women caught in the complex web of Muslim society.  About the author: Tehmina Durrani A member of one of Pakistani's most influential families, Tehmina Durrani decided to write this book about they way women are treated in Pakistan after leaving her husband Mustafa Khar. In the writing of My Feudal Lord, Tehmina Durrani worked with William Hoffer, author of Midnight Express and co-author of Betty Mahmoody's Not Without My Daughter.

"GANDHI: STRUGGLING FOR AUTONOMY (pb)2001","This compelling introduction to Gandhi's political thought goes beyond his well-known writings to present a much broader portrait that will be valuable to students of political theory, philosophy, and history. Using the principle of individual autonomy-rather than civil disobedience, Indian independence, or duty-as an analytical lens, Ronald J. Terchek offers a completely original interpretation of his subject's political thought. Terchek argues that Gandhi's thought is animated by a concern for the equal respect and regard for all persons, and he describes how Gandhi's writings illuminate several critical discourses in political theory, debates that overlap with many Western writers to whom Gandhi is seldom compared. Throughout the book, Terchek demonstrates that the teachings and work of Gandhi continue to be relevant today, and that he should be viewed as a significant political thinker not only within the Hindu tradition but in the broader context of 20th century political thought.  Ronald J. Terchek is professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland, College Park, and the author of ","PKR 981.00","RONALD J.

"YASH CHOPRA: FIFTY YEARS IN INDIAN CINEMA (hb)2002","Yash Chopra: Fifty years in Indian Cinema looks at one of the most charismatic and powerful figures within the Indian film industry—his name being synonymous with romantic glamour and a certain style within Indian culture. From his directorial debut in 1959 with Dhool ka Phool, the book spans his four decades as a director, describing some memorable classics like Deewar and Kabhi Kabhie. It journeys with him to his advent as a producer in 1973, enumerating his enormous box-office hits during the ’90s, including Dilwale Dulhania le Jayenge. It encompasses the other genres he successfully delved into with films such as Darr and Mashaal. The author examines how Chopra has transformed the look of popular Indian cinema through tireless innovation within a mainstream tradition; his professional relationship with megastar Amitabh Bachchan; the influence of others, particularly Raj Kapoor, on his cinema, and his legacy as being developed by his son Aditya Chopra. These analyses are complemented with insights and comments on the man and his oeuvre, through interviews with his family, his colleagues, his stars, his contemporaries and critics.  About the Author Rachel Dwyer is senior lecturer in Indian studies at SOAS (Deptt. of South Asia), University of London. Her recent books include All You Want Is Money, All You Need Is Love: Sex and Romance in Modern India and Cinema India: The Visual Culture of the Hindi Film, co-authored with Divia Patel.

From 1942 until his death she was at his side in the bunker, typing his correspondence, his speeches and even his last private and political will and testament. It was only after the war that the horrible reality of Hitler's regime began to dawn on her, and she became racked with guilt for 'liking the greatest criminal ever to have lived.' Her journal, written in 1947, is a startling eyewitness account of Hitler's court during its final years, and of the building sense of doom as the war progressed   Author: Traudl Junge and Melissa Muller      ","PKR 545.00","TRAUDL JUNGE",0753817926,2003,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,Paperback,English,261,images/books/0753817926.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=0753817926&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"BAGHDAD DIARIES: WOMAN'S CHRONICLE OF WAR AND EXILE, A (pb)2003","In this often moving, sometimes wry account of life in Baghdad during the first war on Iraq and in exile in the years following, Iraqi-born, British-educated artist Nuha al-Radi shows us the effects of war on ordinary people. She recounts the day-to-day realities of living in a city under siege, where food has to be consumed or thrown out because there is no way to preserve it, where eventually people cannot sleep until the nightly bombing commences, where packs of stray dogs roam the streets (and provide her own dog Salvi with a harem) and rats invade homes. Through it all, al-Radi works at her art and gathers with neighbors and family for meals and other occasions, happy and sad.   In the wake of the war, al-Radi lives in semi-exile, shuttling between Beirut and Amman, travelling to New York, London, Mexico and Yemen. As she suffers the indignities of being an Iraqi in exile, al-Radi immerses us in a way of life constricted by the stress and effects of war and embargoes, giving texture to a reality we have only been able to imagine before now. But what emanates most vibrantly from these diaries is the spirit of endurance and the celebration of the smallest of life’s joys.  Author: Nuha al-Radi, is a cosmopolitan, Western-educated Iraqi woman who writes with surprising humor and stoicism about the reality of daily life in Baghdad during the first Gulf War and the subsequent bleak years under sanctions. She describes the difficulties of day-to-day survival but also the funny and macabre goings-on about town. Following her into exile in Jordan and later Beirut, the diary continues to November 2002. It ends with several dramatic new entries written as Baghdad is bombed again and U.S. troops advance towards the city.

"DAUGHTERS OF ARABIA (pb)2004","Readers of Princess Sultana's extraordinary biography Princess were gripped by her powerful indictment of women's lives behind the veil within the royal family of Saudi Arabia. They were every bit as fascinated by the sequel, Daughters of Arabia.  Here, the princess turns the spotlight on her two daughters, Maha and Amani, both teenagers. Surrounded by untold opulence and luxury from the day they were born, but stifled by the unbearably restrictive lifestyle imposed on them, they reacted in equally desperate ways.   Their dramatic and shocking stories, together with many more which concern other members of Princess Sultana's huge family, are set against a rich backdrop of Saudi Arabian culture and social mores which she depicts with equal colour and authenticity. We learn, for example, of the fascinating ritual of the world-famous annual pilgrimage to Makkah as we accompany the princess and her family to this holiest of cities. Throughout, however, she never tires of her quest to expose the injustices which her society levels against women. In her courageous campaign to improve the lot of her own daughters of Arabia, Princess Sultana once more strikes a chord amongst all women who are lucky enough to have the freedom to speak out for themselves.

PRINCESS,"In a land where Kings still rule, I am a Princess. You must know me only as Sultana, for I cannot reveal my true name for fear that harm will come to me and my family for what I am about to tell you.  Think of a Saudi Arabian princess and what do you see? A woman glittering with jewels, living a life of unbelievable luxury. She has gold, palaces, swimming-pools, servants, designer dresses galore. But in reality she lives in a gilded cage. She has no freedom, no vote, no control over her own life, no value but as a bearer of sons. Hidden behind the veil, she is a prisoner, her jailers her father, her husband, her sons.  'Sultana' is a member of the Saudi royal family, closely related to the King. For the sake of her daughters, she decided that it was time for a woman in her position to speak out about the reality of life for women in her country, whatever their rank. She tells of her own life, from her turbulent childhood to her arranged marriage - a happy one, until her husband decided to take a second wife - and of the lives of her sisters, her friends and her servants. In contrast to the affection and easy camaraderie amongst the women, she relates a history of appalling oppression against them, everyday occurrences that in any other culture would be seen as shocking human rights violations: forced marriages, servants bullied into sex slavery, summary executions.  Princess is a testimony to a woman of indomitable spirit and great courage. By speaking out, 'Sultana' risked bringing the wrath of the Saudi establishment upon her head and upon the heads of her children. For this reason, she told her story anonymously.

"NO ROOM FOR SECRETS (hb)2004","The reader and I are only interested in the truth. Recklessly generously illustrated. This is the book I've been secretly longing to write. There is so much in my overstuffed life that I've never talked about publicly before. All the things I love and dread are here: objects, photographs, people, letters, ideas, regrets, memories, journeys, being a model in the sixties, a daughter of the regiment, a friend of Dirk Bogarde; things I believe in, people I've met and can't forget; slumming it, lording it, failure and survival. I wanted to write about eyeliner as well as sleeping under shrunken heads in a longhouse; being an honorary New Yorker, death (and why I think about it daily) and how to get thinner fast. To give it structure I have devised a framework which is in fact, My House. I shall show the reader into every room, from front door to attic window, walking through the (colossally) sustained metaphor of my life, answering questions (which I have cunningly put) about all the stuff in the place; my things: me. Why are you photographed with the Dalai Lama? Is this the teddy bear you had on your bed at school? Did you draw this picture of your son? Why did you make these pathetic curtains? Who are you? Do you lie to the press?  About the Author Joanna Lumley was born in India and grew up in England and the Far East. She started out modeling for Jean Muir and soon went on to become one of Britain's best-loved actresses. Renowned for her roles both on the screen and in the theatre, Joanna has played the part of leggy Purdey in The New Avengers, a Bond Girl in On Her Majesty's Secret Service and perhaps most famously as Patsy Stone in the Bafta Award winning series Absolutely Fabulous. Her first autobiography Stare Back and Smile was published in 1989 and in 1995, Joanna was awarded with an OBE shortly after making the documentary film Girl Friday.","PKR 3,742.00","JOANNA LUMLEY",0718146824,2004,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,"Hard Cover",English,264,images/books/0718146824.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=0718146824&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"AMERICAN LOOKS AT GANDHI, AN (hb)2005","In this far-reaching series of essays, author James Hunt examines the complex set of influences which helped shape Mohandas K. Gandhi leading to the transformation of an anglophile Indian lawyer into the Mahatma of historical myth. James Hunt is able to expand the existing scholarship on Gandhi and to deepen our understanding of the formation of his intellectual and spiritual program. These essays take the reader on a tour of teh 'stimulating interactions'- the encounters which brought a young Gandhi into dialogue witha remarkable selection of individiuals and movements in South Africa and London. Hunt not only traces the complex and often suprising development of key Gandhian concepts like ahimsa, he also helps clear away persistent misconceptions while pointing out numerous unresolved questions which pave the way for future historical inquiry.    About the Author   James D.Hunt is an emeritus professor in humanities and philosophy from Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.A. Born in Massachusetts in 1931, he obtained degrees in sociology and theology at Tufts University and Boston University, and for several years was a minister in the Unitarian Universalist Church.

"MIRZA GHALIB: AIK SAWANI MANZAR NAMA (hb)2005","Mirza Ghalib yet stands unparalleled in the world of Urdu poetry. His body of work was not just reflective of the turbulent times that he wrote in but also resonated with beauty culture passion love longing and was resplendent with imagery. His ghazals are unique as he wrote about all the phases of life. He was endowed with a passionate appreciation of life yet deeply questioned the very fundamentals of faith and dogma. His philosophy and views on the times that he lived and worked in are the most relevant. Ghalib is inarguably one of the greatest poets of all times.Based on the eponymous serial made by renowned director lyricist and poet Gulzar this book presents Mirza Ghalib’s life and poetry in the form of a scenario moving away from the conventional format of a biography. Mirza Ghalib: A Biographical Scenario is an extremely important historic and creative document.   Author: GULZAR is one of Indian cinema’s most sensitive and creative directors; a lyricist par excellence; one whose work never fails to surprise bring a tear to the eye or a smile on the lips; a humble man with humble beginnings who is unafraid of experimenting. A career that began more than three decades ago comprises a rich repertoire of not just films but also authoring several anthologies of short stories including Raavi Paar and Other Stories. One of the two immensely popular television serials that he has directed has been on the life of Mirza Ghalib who commands Gulzar’s heartstrings and the most recent one is based on the works of one of Indian literature’s greats Munshi Premchand. Winner of the Sahitya Akademi award Gulzar’s interest in literature is more than just a passing fancy. He writes poetry short stories all his works have been translated into English and he is the creator of the three-line poem called Triveni.

"SPACE OF HER OWN: PERSONAL NARRATIVES OF TWELVE WOMEN","Focusing on relationships between women of different generations in India, this book comprises of narratives demonstrating how each contributor established her own personhood through engagement with a wider kin group.   Did the women portrayed in the narratives find space for themselves within orthodox structures? Or, were they so constrained by the social roles of the greatest importance to their families - as wives and mothers - that ending these roles meant some kind of death? How did their lives mould those of the narrators of these life histories?

"MEMORIES COME ALIVE: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY (W/CD) (pb)2007","In Memories Come Alive: An Autobiography, Manna Dey takes a nostalgic trip down memory lane--his early passion for wrestling and football; adolescent pranks which involved shoplifting sweets from a confectionery and pole-valuating into the neighbour's terrace to swipe pickle jars; and the influence of his uncle and guru K.C. Dey (the celebrated singer and composer of the 1930s). He recounts his early days in Mumbai as an assistant music director to his uncle and to composers like S.D. Burman and vividly recalls the struggle to carve a niche as a playback singer in Hindi films, competing with Stalwarts like Rafi, Mukesh and Kishore Kumar. He also discusses at length his foray into the world of Bengali film and non-film music where he came to be regarded as the undisputed king of melody. Peppered with interesting anecdotes like his kite duels with Rafi, priceless nuggets on how some of his famous songs came to be written and composed, stories of his enduring relationships with people like Raj Kapoor and Majrooh Sultanpuri, Pulak Bandopadhyay and Sudhin Dasgupta, and boasting of the most comprehensive list of his songs ever compiled, Memories Come Alive is a must-read not only for the legions of Manna Dey fans but also for connoisseurs of popular music in India.

"NO ONE TAKES MY CHILDREN (pb)2007","In March 2003, Donya al-Nahi's worst nightmare came true when her Iraqi husband took their daughter and youngest son and fled to the Middle East. Donya immediately begged and borrowed whatever funds she could and flew there to begin the hunt. But the search came to nothing, and she was forced to return home without her two missing children. A further trip with a private detective also proved fruitless, and Donya's hopes began to fade. As the fighting in Iraq continued and Saddam Hussein's regime was overthrown, she received news that her husband had returned to his home town of Najaf with the children. She knew she had no choice but to follow—and nothing would stand in her way this time. No One Takes My Children is the gripping account of Donya's heroic quest. It is a dramatic, emotional, and ultimately inspiring story of how one woman's determination and courage in the face of extremely daunting odds brought about the reunion of her family.  Author: Donya al-Nahi was born in Surrey of Scottish parents and currently lives in London with her four children. Eugene Costello is a jornalist who has has written extensively for national newspapers and magazines. He is also the author of White Gold.

"BIN LADENS: AN ARABIAN FAMILY IN THE AMERICAN CENTURY, THE (hb)2008","Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and author of the national bestseller Ghost Wars, Steve Coll presents the story of the Bin Laden family’s rise to power and privilege, revealing new information to show how American influences changed the family and how one member’s rebellion changed America  The Bin Ladens rose from poverty to privilege; they loyally served the Saudi royal family for generations—and then one of their number changed history on September 11, 2001. Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Coll tells the epic story of the rise of the Bin Laden family and of the wildly diverse lifestyles of the generation to which Osama bin Laden belongs, and against whom he rebelled. Starting with the family’s escape from famine at the beginning of the twentieth century through its jet-set era in America after the 1970s oil boom, and finally to the family’s attempts to recover from September 11, The Bin Ladens unearths extensive new material about the family and its relationship with the United States, and provides a richly revealing and emblematic narrative of our globally interconnected times.  To a much greater extent than has been previously understood, the Bin Laden family owned an impressive share of the America upon which Osama ultimately declared war—shopping centers, apartment complexes, luxury estates, privatized prisons in Massachusetts, corporate stocks, an airport, and much more. They financed Hollywood movies and negotiated over real estate with Donald Trump. They came to regard George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Prince Charles as friends of their family. And yet, as was true of the larger relationship between the Saudi and American governments, when tested by Osama’s violence, the family’s involvement in the United States proved to be narrow and brittle.  Among the many memorable figures that cross these pages is Osama’s older brother, Salem—a free-living, chainsmoking, guitar-strumming pilot, adventurer, and businessman who cavorted across America and Europe and once proposed marriage to four American and European girlfriends simultaneously, attempting to win a bet with the king of Saudi Arabia. Osama and Salem’s father, Mohamed bin Laden, is another force in the narrative—an illiterate bricklayer who created the family fortune through perspicacity and wit, until his sudden death in an airplane crash in 1967, an accident caused by an error by his American pilot.  At the story’s heart lies an immigrant family’s attempt to adapt simultaneously to Saudi Arabia’s puritanism and America’s myriad temptations. The family generation to which Osama belonged—twenty-five brothers and twenty-nine sisters—had to cope with intense change. Most of them were born into a poor society where religion dominated public life. Yet by the time they became young adults, these Bin Ladens found themselves bombarded by Western-influenced ideas about individual choice, by gleaming new shopping malls and international fashion brands, by Hollywood movies and changing sexual mores—a dizzying world that was theirs for the taking, because they each received annual dividends that started in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. How they navigated these demands is an authentic, humanizing story of Saudi Arabia, America, and the sources of attraction and repulsion still present in the countries’ awkward embrace.  Steve Coll is a writer for The New Yorker and author of the Pulitzer Prize- winning Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001. He is president of the New America Foundation, a public policy institute in Washington, D.C. Previously he served, for more than twenty years, as a reporter, foreign correspondent, and ultimately as managing editor of The Washington Post. He is also the author of On the Grand Trunk Road, The Deal of the Century, and The Taking of Getty Oil. Coll received a 1990 Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism and the 2001 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for outstanding international print reporting and the 2000 Overseas Press Club Award for best magazine reporting from abroad. Ghost Wars, published in 2004, received the Pulitzer for general nonfiction and the Arthur Ross award for the best book on international affairs.","PKR 1,995.00","STEVE COLL",9781594201646,2008,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,"Hard Cover",English,671,images/books/9781594201646.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781594201646&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"BEHENJI: A POLITICAL BIOGRAPHY OF MAYAWATI (pb)2009","How did Mayawati become the iconoclastic, combative politician, universally known as ‘Behenji’ today?’  Is there a historic parallel anywhere else where a woman belonging to the most crushed community known to mankind has risen through the heat and dust of elections to rule two  hundred million people and may well reach further to guide the destiny of a billion more in the not too distant future? Mayawati has changed the face of politics in India, turning old assumptions upside down and restructuring power equations entrenched for centuries, if not millennia. The path she has blazed through the Byzantine political system of Uttar Pradesh has been a unique tour de force. Not only has she been the chief minister four times, but she has done so by overturning the established electoral traditions of a state that virtually invented modern Indian politics. With her in-your-face political style, unabashed display of accumulated wealth and mercurial nature, she is, perhaps, the most enigmatic Indian politician for decades. Eminent journalist Ajoy Bose brings his in-depth experience of covering Indian politics for over three decades to this pioneering political biography of Mayawati. He explores the background of her meteoric rise and examines the growing national clout of this unique woman who could, quite possibly, determine the shape of the next Indian government, and even be the country s prime minister one day.

"MARRIED TO A BEDOUIN (pb)2009","New Zealand born nurse Marguerite van Geldermalsen first visited the lost city Petra with her friend Elizabeth in 1978 on a sightseeing tour of the ancient world. Already looking forward to her beach holiday at the end of the trip, little did Maguerite know she was about to meet the man she would marry, the charismatic Mohammad Abdallah Othman, a Bedouin craftsman of the Manajah tribe. A life with Mohammad meant moving into his ancient cave and learning to love the regular tasks of baking shrak bread on an open fire and collecting water from the spring. But as Marguerite feels herself becoming part of the Bedouin community, she is thankful for the twist in fate that has led her to this contented life. Marguerite’s light-hearted and guileless observations of the people she comes to love are as heart-warming as they are valuable, charting Bedouin traditions now lost to the modern world.  Author: Marguerite van Geldermalsen was widowed in 2002. She now divides her time between Sydney, Australia, and Jordan.

"KILLING MY OWN SNAKES (pb)2009","She has been shot at by Bosnian snipers, been pursued by Robert Mugabe’s notorious secret police, fled from the North Korean border, propositioned by both Salvador Dali and David Niven, and been driven maniacally through London by Steve McQueen. But Ann Leslie’s life is every bit as remarkable as her career. A daughter of the Raj, she was born in India and the strongest influence on her early life was an illiterate Pashtun bearer, who saved her life during Partition. Her mother, a great beauty, was indifferent to her eldest daughter and she was sent to the first of a series of boarding-schools aged just four, eventually winning a scholarship to Oxford. After graduating she began her career at the Manchester office of the Daily Express, where the news editor took an instant dislike to her—she was a southerner, educated and—worst of all—female. Despite his best efforts she was soon given her own column. Then, after a stint covering show business she was appointed Foreign Correspondent of the Daily Mail, an association that endures today, almost 40 years later, and one which finally allowed her real talent to shine through. Killing My Own Snakes is a witty, incident-filled account of an extraordinary life, a fascinating self-portrait of one the most influential journalists of our time.

"AMEN: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A NUN (pb)2009","On 31 August 2008, Sister Jesme left the Congregation of Mother of Carmel. The authorities repeated attempts to have her declared insane, she says, left her no other option. This book, a first of its kind in India, is an outpouring of her experiences as a nun for thirty-three years. Spirited and fun-loving, from a good family, deeply-rooted in Catholicism, Jesme was drawn to religious life at seventeen after a Retreat at junior college. As a nun, seven years later, she felt distressed at the many ills growing inside the convent and being forced to remain silent about them. There was corruption, by way of donations for college seats; sexual relations between some priests and nuns, and between nuns; class distinctions whereby the cheduthies, or poorer and less-educated sisters, did menial jobs; and a wide gap between comforts and facilities enjoyed by the priests and nuns. Jesme was permitted to complete her doctorate in English Literature, to pursue her passion for literature, cinema and teaching college students. She exposed them to classic films, believing that aesthetics enhances spirituality. But these joys were clouded by the troubles she faced.

"ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE: DEMOCRACY'S GUIDE (EMINENT LIVES) (pb)2009","Alexis de Tocqueville was among the first foreigners to recognize and trumpet the grandness of the American project. His two-volume classic, Democracy in America, published in 1835, offered not only a vivid account of the still young nation but famously predicted what the nation would become, and firmly established his place in U.S. history. Yet in his own time, Tocqueville had little evidence for the truth of his ideas. Introspective, sickly, prone to self-doubt, he was a most unlikely visionary. In wry, elegant prose, Joseph Epstein, America's most versatile essayist, offers an engaging and altogether human portrait of the Frenchman who would become an American icon.  Joseph Epstein is the author of, among other books, Snobbery: The American Version, Fabulous Small Jews (a collection of stories), Envy, and Friendship: An ExposÉ. He was the editor of The American Scholar between 1974 and 1997, and for many years taught in the English Department at Northwestern University. His essays and stories have appeared in the New Yorker, Commentary, the Atlantic Monthly, and other magazines.","PKR 2,287.00","JOSEPH EPSTEIN",9780061768880,2009,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,Paperback,English,205,images/books/9780061768880.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780061768880&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT: THE IRREPRESSIBLE LIFE OF JAMES LOVELOCK (pb)2009","Jim Lovelock is an iconic figure in British science, a prophet whose prophecies are coming true. This is his definitive authorised biography. Lovelock is best known as the 'father' of Gaia theory, which is now established as the most useful way of understanding the dramatic changes happening to the environment of the Earth. But few people know about his early work as a chemist and inventor - work which included inventing the detectors used to search for life on Mars, and blowing the whistle on the depletion of ozone layer. In his personal life, he was a Quaker and conscientious objector in World War Two (later changing his mind in view of the evils of Nazism), supported his family for a time by selling his own blood, and gave up a salary and security to become an independent scientist based in an English village - from which all his best known work emerged. As he approaches his 90th birthday, looking forward to going into space, this book truly reveals an independent, original and inspiring life.  About the Author John and Mary Gribbin are two of today's greatest writers of popular science. Together they have collaborated on many books, including Ice Age, Richard Feynman: A Life in Science and Stardust.

The outbreak of the 'Yom Kippur War' took both Israel and the US by surprise, the Vietnam War finally ended, it was the year of detente with the Soviet Union, but the US executive was in a state of collapse following Watergate, and the year ended with the muslim initiated energy crisis, which brought the Western world to the brink of economic disaster - a story of deepest relevance today. 1973 was also very much the year of Henry Kissinger, Nixon's National Security advisor and later Secretary of State - possibly the most powerful in American history, running US foreign policy in default of a 'lame duck' president. It was also the year that Kissinger was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. This book is the biography of Kissinger - the first he has authorised - viewed through the events of this crucial year.

Salman's tale provides insight into the political and religious history of Pakistan, which has recently dominated the news as political instability threatens to tear apart an Islamic nation armed with nuclear weapons and teeming with Al-Qaeda sympathizers. But, more importantly, it provides a glimpse into the life of a unique man who personally serves as a bridge of civilizations at a time when many fear that Islam and the West are doomed to clash eternally.

"SACHIN: THE STORY OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST BATSMAN REVISED AND UPDATED EDITION (pb)2010","In the twenty years that he has been in the public eye, Sachin Tendulkar has been explosive on the cricket field and just as reticent off it. He was barely fifteen years old when he first wrote his name into record books with a stupendous 664-run partnership with his childhood friend Vinod Kambli. A few months later, he struck his first century in first-class cricket. At seventeen he became the second youngest man to make a hundred in international cricket, and after that there was no looking back. Today, Sachin is widely regarded as the world’s finest Batsman, with impeccable technique, an incredible array of strokes, and maturity far beyond his years.   In this biography of the hero of Indian cricket, sports writer Gulu Ezekiel mines interviews, press reports and conversations over the last two decades and more to create an accurate and sympathetic account of the man and his first passion: cricket. He tracks Sachin from his childhood when he first caught the bug of cricket, through his early performances in the Ranji Trophy and other domestic tournaments, and follows him on his meteoric rise to international stardom. With unfailing attention to detail, he reconstructs the crucial matches and events that marked Sachin’s career and unravels for us the magic of the charismatic cricketer whom Wisden Cricket Monthly once dubbed ‘bigger than Jesus’  Author: Gulu Ezekiel","PKR 1,038.00","GULU EZEKIEL",9780143066903,2010,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,Paperback,English,408,images/books/9780143066903.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780143066903&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"STARS FROM ANOTHER SKY, THE BOMBAY FILM WORLD OF THE 1940s (pb)2010","Unforgettable reminiscences about the eccentric, glamorous, yet angst-ridden Hindi film world of the 1940s. Saadat Hasan Manto, one of the greatest short story writers of the Urdu language, was also a film journalist and story-writer for the Hindi film industry in Bombay. As an insider he was privy to the most private moments of the men and women who have dazzled generations of audiences.   In this series of sketches, Ashok Kumar, the screen idol of yore, emerges as a shy, yet brilliant actor, forever looking to flee the eager advances of his female fans; Nargis comes across as just another young girl looking for companionship among her peers before she steps on the ladder that will forever take her away from the comforts of an ordinary middle-class life; and Shyam—the dashing, handsome hero—is portrayed as a straightforward, flirtatious young man pining for the woman he loves.   Manto also describes in detail the obsessions of Sitara Devi; the unfulfilled desires of Paro Devi; and the intriguing twists and turns which transform Neena Devi from an ordinary housewife into a pawn in the hands of film companies. He writes with relish about the bunglings of the comedian V.H. Desai and the incredible dedication of Nawab Kaashmiri to the art of acting. There are also stories about the rise of Nur Jehan as the greatest singer of her times; and the various peccadilloes of the musician, Rafiq Ghaznavi.   With subjects ranging from film journalism to the sexual eccentricities of these stars, Manto brings to life a generation with his characteristic verve and honesty.

"SONGS OF BLOOD AND SWORD: A DAUGHTER'S MEMOIR (pb)2010","In September 1996, a fourteen-year-old Fatima Bhutto hid in a windowless dressing room, shielding her baby brother while shots rang out in the streets outside the family home in Karachi. This was the evening that her father Murtaza was murdered, along with six of his associates. In December 2007, Benazir Bhutto, Fatima’s aunt, and the woman she had publically accused of ordering her father’s murder, was assassinated in Rawalpindi. It was the latest in a long line of tragedies for one of the world’s best known political dynasties.  Songs of Blood and Sword tells the story of a family of rich feudal landlords – the proud descendents of a warrior caste – who became powerbrokers in the newly created state of Pakistan. It is an epic tale full of the romance and legend of feudal life, the glamour and licence of the international political elite and ultimately, the tragedy of four generations of a family defined by a political idealism that would destroy them.  The history of this extraordinary family mirrors the tumultuous events of Pakistan itself, and the quest to find the truth behind her father’s murder has led Fatima to the heart of her country’s volatile political establishment. It is the history of a nation from Partition through the struggle with India over Kashmir, the Cold War, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan up to the post 9/11 “War on Terror.”  It is also a book about a daughter’s love for her father and her search to uncover, and to understand, the truth of his life and death. It is a book about a family and nation riven by murder, corruption, conspiracy and division, written by one who has lived it, in the heart of the storm.  Songs of Blood and Sword is a book of international significance by a young woman who has already established herself as a brave and passionate campaigner.

"SIPS FROM A BROKEN TEACUP: SKETCHES FROM LIFE ON AN ASSAMESE TEA PLANTATION (hb) 2011","A young bride from Karachi learns to cope with isolation and the hazards of the wild in East Pakistan’s remote tea plantations (once a part of Assam); the unusual people who inhabited them; their culture and eccentricities; and the changes that occurred as the remnants of the Raj gave way to the resentment against West Pakistan that would tear the country apart in 1971.     On the fortieth anniversary of the loss of East Pakistan, this first-hand account recreates the esoteric world of tea and chronicles the planters’ vicissitudes during the turmoil and bloodshed of the civil war which consigned an entire era and way of life to oblivion. It also tells a very personal story of divided loyalties, of friendship and betrayal, and of the courage and compassion of ordinary people of every race, region and religion.  Author: Raihana A. Hasan As the wife of a planter, Raihana A. Hasan spent nearly ten years on plantations in Sylhet, East Pakistan and lived through the violence and terror unleashed by the general election of 1970. Since then, she has had a varied career in education, advertising, commercial aviation, freelance editing, translation and writing.  ","PKR 900.00","RAIHANA A.

"IN FREEDOM'S SHADE (pb)2011","Appearing for the first time in English translation, In Freedom’s Shade is Anis Kidwai’s moving personal memoir of the first two years of nascent India. It is an activist’s record that reveals both the architecture of the violence during Partition as well as the efforts of ordinary citizens to bring the cycle of reprisal and retribution to a close.  Beginning from the murder of her husband in October 1947, with a rare frankness, sympathy and depth of insight, Anis Kidwai tells the stories of the thousands who were driven away from their homelands in Delhi and its neighbouring areas by eviction or abduction or the threat of forced religious conversion. Of historical importance for its account of the activities of the Shanti Dal, the recovery of abducted women and the history of Delhi, In Freedom’s Shade also has an equal contemporary relevance. In part a delineation of the roots of the afflictions that beset Indian society and in part prophetic about the plagues that were to come, Anis Kidwai’s testament is an enduring reminder that memory without truth is futile; only when it serves the objective of reconciliation, does it achieve meaning and significance.  Anis Kidwai was born in 1906 in Barabanki into a somewhat impoverished but nonetheless literate and cultured zamindari family of Awadh. Until the death of her father when she was eleven years old, Anis was fortunate enough to receive a rigorous education. Thereafter, Anis remained sequestered behind the purdah until the late 1930s when the last decade of India’s freedom struggle allowed her a greater degree of participation in outside events. It was the murder of her husband, Shafi, in Mussoorie in October 1947 that catapulted Anis into the activist role that she had always dreamt of.

"MATTERS OF DISCRETION: AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY (hb)2011","I. K. Gujral (born on 4 December 1919) has penned his life story in as forthright and candid a manner as possible. He entered the political fray as a freedom fighter in the British era and, after the tumultuous events that rocked the Indian subcontinent in the wake of partition in August 1947, crossed over from Pakistan to India, where he had to begin life from scratch. Despite facing tremendous odds, on the basis of his perseverance, resilience and never-say-die attitude, Gujral achieved a remarkable track record, and, in the process, witnessed the making of modern India.  Gujral joined the Congress Party and was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1964. This was the beginning of a long innings, both in the national and international fields. In Indira Gandhi’s Government, over the years, he held several portfolios such as the Union minister for communications, parliamentary affairs and works and housing. He was the information and broadcasting minister when Emergency was imposed (on 25 June 1975), which entailed arbitrary press censorship. Since he refused to kowtow to the de facto powers that be, he was unceremoniously replaced and later sent by Indira Gandhi as India’s ambassador to the USSR, a post he handled with commendable tact and finesse, even during the tenures of her two successors, Morarji Desai and Charan Singh.  After his stint in Moscow, he returned to India and re-entered the ‘political whirlpool’ by joining the Janata Dal. He became the minister for external affairs, first under V. P. Singh (in December 1989) and then under Deve Gowda (in June 1996). He throws new light on the pressures and counter pressures and on the intrigues and counter intrigues that led to the fall of the V. P. Singh Government on 7th November 1990 and also to that of the Deve Gowda Government on 11 April 1997.  Gujral attained the pinnacle when he became the prime minister on 21 April 1997. During his prime  ministership, despite the exigencies and pressures of running a coalition government, he endeavoured to achieve progress in many spheres, including foreign affairs. The Gujral Doctrine (a set of five principles to guide the conduct of foreign relations with India’s immediate neighbours) was widely acclaimed not only in India but also in the West. However, forces inimical to his government soon began making their presence felt.  He takes the reader backstage to highlight the ‘drama’ that resulted in his exit.  This volume, a valuable addition to the literature on contemporary history, provides a deep insight into the political scene as it unfolded after independence and also delineates the roles – sometimes positive and sometimes negative – played by a wide spectrum of not only politicians but also bureaucrats and others.

"TEN POPES WHO SHOOK THE WORLD (hb)2011","The Bishops of Rome have been Christianity's most powerful leaders for nearly two millennia, and their influence has extended far beyond the purely spiritual. The popes have played a central role in the history of Europe and the wider world, not only shouldering the spiritual burdens of their ancient office, but also in contending with - and sometimes precipitating - the cultural and political crises of their times. In an acclaimed series of BBC radio broadcasts Eamon Duffy explored the impact of ten popes he judged to be among 'the most influential in history'. With this book, readers may now also enjoy Duffy's portraits of ten exceptional men who shook the world.  The book begins with St Peter, the Rock upon whom the Catholic Church was built, and follows with Leo the Great (fifth century), Gregory the Great (sixth century), Gregory VII (eleventh century), Innocent III (thirteenth century), Paul III (sixteenth century), and Pius IX (nineteenth century). Among twentieth-century popes, Duffy examines the lives and contributions of Pius XII, who was elected on the eve of the Second World War, the kindly John XXIII, who captured the world's imagination, and John Paul II, the first non-Italian pope in 450 years. Each of these ten extraordinary individuals, Duffy shows, shaped their own worlds, and in the process, helped to create ours.. Each of these ten, Duffy shows, was an extraordinary individual who helped shape the world we know today.  Author: Eamon Duffy is professor of the history of Christianity, Cambridge University, and fellow and former president of Magdalene College. He is the author of many prizewinning books, among them Fires of Faith, Marking the Hours, and Saints and Sinners, all available from Yale University Press. He lives in Cambridge, UK.

"KNOWN AND UNKNOWN: A MEMOIR (hb)2011","Few Americans have spent more time near the center of power than Donald Rumsfeld. Now he has written an unflinching memoir of his half-century career, sharing previously undisclosed details that will fascinate readers and force historians to rethink many controversies.   Starting from a middle-class childhood in Illinois, Rumsfeld had a rapid rise that won him early acclaim. He shows us what it was like growing up during the Great Depression and World War II, going to Princeton on scholarships, serving as a naval aviator, then getting his first political job on Capitol Hill during the Eisenhower administration. He recalls how he won a seat in the House of Representatives at age thirty and what he experienced as a Republican in Congress during the Kennedy and Johnson years.   We also follow him back to the executive branch as he took on key cabinet positions in the Nixon and Ford administrations, including his service as the youngest-ever secretary of defense, just after the trauma of Vietnam. And we learn about the challenges he later faced as a CEO in the private sector, and during his special assignments for President Reagan, including a face-to-face meeting with Saddam Hussein in 1983.   All of that would have been enough material for a fascinating book. But as 2001 began, Rumsfeld's greatest challenges lay ahead of him. At age sixty-eight he returned to the Pentagon as President Bush's secretary of defense, with a mandate to transform the military for a new century. Just nine months later he would confront the worst acts of terrorism in American history, followed by unexpected wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. And he would be on the firing line for many controversies, from the revelations of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to allegations of torture at Guantánamo Bay.   Known and Unknown reveals what happened behind the scenes during the critical moments of the Bush years, as the President's inner circle debated how best to defend our country. It is based not only on Rumsfeld's memory but also on hundreds of previously unreleased documents from throughout his career. It also features his blunt, firsthand opinions about some of the world's best-known figures, from Margaret Thatcher to Elvis Presley, from Henry Kissinger to Colin Powell, and about each American president from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George W. Bush.

"MALCOLM X: A LIFE OF REINVENTION (hb)2011","Of the figures who tower over twentieth century American history, perhaps none is more complex, more multifaceted and controversial, than Malcolm X. Constantly rewriting his own story, he became a criminal, a minister, a leader, and eventually an icon, eventually assassinated at the age of 39. The details of his life have long since calcified into a familiar narrative: his early years as a vagabond in Boston and New York, his conversion to Islam and subsequent rise to prominence as a militant advocate for black rights, his acrimonious split with the Nation of Islam, and ultimately his violent death at their hands. Yet this story, told and retold to various ends by writers, historians, and filmmakers, captures only a snapshot, a fraction of the man in full.  To truly understand Malcolm, we need to go deeper, to find the source of his voluminous rage and charisma. Manning Marable's new biography of Malcolm is a stunning achievement, the culmination of years of research and dogged pursuit of those who knew him, many of whom have never before spoken about him on the record. Filled with new information and shocking revelations that will reframe the way we understand his life and work, Malcolm X unfolds a sweeping story of the darkest days of racial unrest, from the rise of the Ku Klux Klan to the struggles of the civil rights movement. Marable reaches deep into Malcolm's troubled youth, tracing a path from the activism of his Garveyite parents through his own engagement with the Nation of Islam, and examining the romantic relationships whose energy alternately drained him and pushed him to unimagined heights.  Malcolm X will stand as the definitive work on one of the most important figures in the history of civil rights, surpassing previous treatments in its depth and intensity, and capturing with revelatory clarity a man who constantly strove, in the great American tradition, to remake himself anew.

Along with officers and other ranks of mostly non-Bengali origin, he was held in an Indian POW Camp that was established in April 1971 despite the fact that the India-Pakistan War that led to the creation of Bangladesh did not break out until December 1971.

"INTERVENTIONS: A LIFE IN WAR AND PEACE","Receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in December 2001, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke to a world still reeling from the terrorist attacks of September 11. “Ladies and Gentlemen,” proclaimed Annan, “we have entered the third millennium through a gate of fire. If today, after the horror of 11 September, we see better, and we see further—we will realize that humanity is indivisible. New threats make no distinction between races, nations, or regions.” Yet within only a few years the world was more divided than ever—polarized by the American invasion of Iraq, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the escalating civil wars in Africa, and the rising influence of China.  Interventions: A Life in War and Peace is the story of Annan’s remarkable time at the center of the world stage. After forty years of service at the United Nations, Annan shares here his unique experiences during the terrorist attacks of September 11; the American invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan; the war between Israel, Hizbollah, and Lebanon; the brutal conflicts of Somalia, Rwanda, and Bosnia; and the geopolitical transformations following the end of the Cold War. With eloquence and unprecedented candor, Interventions finally reveals Annan’s unique role and unparalleled perspective on decades of global politics.  The first sub-Saharan African to hold the position of Secretary-General, Annan has led an extraordinary life in his own right. His idealism and personal politics were forged in the Ghanaian independence movement of his adolescence, when all of Africa seemed to be rising as one to demand self-determination. Schooled in Africa, Europe, and the United States, Annan ultimately joined the United Nations in Geneva at the lowest professional level in the still young organization. Annan rose rapidly through the ranks and was by the end of the Cold War prominently placed in the dramatically changing department of peacekeeping operations. His stories of Presidents Clinton and Bush, dictators like Saddam Hussein and Robert Mugabe, and public figures of all stripes contrast powerfully with Annan’s descriptions of the courage and decency of ordinary people everywhere struggling for a new and better world.   Showing the successes of the United Nations, Annan also reveals the organization’s missed opportunities and ongoing challenges—inaction in the Rwanda genocide, continuing violence between Israelis and Palestinians, and the endurance of endemic poverty. Yet Annan’s great strength in this book is his ability to embed these tragedies within the context of global politics, demonstrating how, time and again, the nations of the world have retreated from the UN’s founding purpose. From the pinnacle of global politics, Annan made it his purpose to put the individual at the center of every mission for peace and prosperity.  A personal biography of global statecraft, Annan’s Interventions is as much a memoir as a guide to world order—past, present, and future.  About the Author KOFI ANNAN was the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations—serving two terms from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 2006—and was the first to emerge from the ranks of United Nations staff. Annan has served the United Nations in various capacities since 1962, including working as the under-secretary-general for peacekeeping operations and the special representative of the secretary-general to the former Yugoslavia. Born in Ghana in 1938, Annan is the first sub-Saharan African to hold the post of secretary-general. In 2001, Kofi Annan and the United Nations were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with the citation praising Annan’s leadership for “bringing new life to the organization.”","PKR 2,495.00","KOFI ANNAN",9781594204203,2012,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,"Hard Cover",English,512,images/books/9781594204203.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781594204203&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"12 YEARS A SLAVE (pb)","“I could not believe that I had never heard of this book. It felt as important as Anne Frank’s Diary 'Steve McQueen,  from the Foreword.  Perhaps the best written of all the slave narratives, Twelve Years a Slave is a harrowing memoir about one of the darkest periods in American history. It recounts how Solomon Northup, born a free man in New York, was lured to Washington, D.C., in 1841 with the promise of fast money, then drugged and beaten and sold into slavery. He spent the next twelve years of his life in captivity on a Louisiana cotton plantation.   After his rescue, Northup published this exceptionally vivid and detailed account of slave life. It became an immediate bestseller and today is recognized for its unusual insight and eloquence as one of the very few portraits of American slavery produced by someone as educated as Solomon Northup, or by someone with the dual perspective of having been both a free man and a slave.    Author: SOLOMON NORTHUP was kidnapped into slavery in Washington, D.C. in 1841. Shortly after his escape, he published his memoirs to great acclaim and brought legal action against his abductors, though they were never persecuted. The details of his life thereafter are unknown, but he is believed to have died in Glen Falls, NY, around 1863.

"THE WORLD IS A CARPET (hb)2013","In the middle of the salt-frosted Afghan desert, in a village so remote that Google can’t find it, a woman squats on top of a loom, making flowers bloom in the thousand threads she knots by hand. Here, where heroin is cheaper than rice, every day is a fast day. B-52s pass overhead—a sign of America’s omnipotence or its vulnerability, the villagers are unsure. They know, though, that the earth is flat—like a carpet.  Anna Badkhen first traveled to this country in 2001, as a war correspondent. She has returned many times since, drawn by a land that geography has made a perpetual battleground, and by a people who sustain an exquisite tradition there. Through the four seasons in which a new carpet is woven by the women and children of Oqa, she immortalizes their way of life much as the carpet does—from the petal half-finished where a hungry infant needs care to the interruptions when the women trade sex  jokes or go fill in for wedding musicians scared away by the Taliban. As Badkhen follows the carpet out into the world beyond, she leaves the reader with an indelible portrait of fates woven by centuries of art, war, and an ancient trade that ultimately binds the invaded to the invader.  Author: Anna Badkhen has won awards for her reporting from the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa, and her native Russia and the Caucasus.

"LOOKING FOR PALESTINE: GROWING UP CONFUSED IN AN ARAB-AMERICAN FAMILY(hb)","A frank and entertaining memoir, from the daughter of Edward Said, about growing up second-generation Arab American and struggling with that identity.  The daughter of a prominent Palestinian father and a sophisticated Lebanese mother, Najla Said grew up in New York City, confused and conflicted about her cultural background and identity. Said knew that her parents identified deeply with their homelands, but growing up in a Manhattan world that was defined largely by class and conformity, she felt unsure about who she was supposed to be, and was often in denial of the differences she sensed between her family and those around her. The fact that her father was the famous intellectual and outspoken Palestinian advocate Edward Said only made things more complicated. She may have been born a Palestinian Lebanese American, but in Said’s mind she grew up first as a WASP, having been baptized Episcopalian in Boston and attending the wealthy Upper East Side girls’ school Chapin, then as a teenage Jew, essentially denying her true roots, even to herself—until, ultimately, the psychological toll of all this self-hatred began to threaten her health.  As she grew older, making increased visits to Palestine and Beirut, Said’s worldview shifted. The attacks on the World Trade Center, and some of the ways in which Americans responded, finally made it impossible for Said to continue to pick and choose her identity, forcing her to see herself and her passions more clearly. Today, she has become an important voice for second-generation Arab Americans nationwide.

"GANDHI BEFORE INDIA","In 1893, when Mohandas Gandhi set sail for South Africa, he was a 23-year-old briefless lawyer who had failed to establish himself in India. The two decades that he spent in South Africa were to be the making of the Mahatma. In this remarkable biography, Ramachandra Guha argues that Gandhi’s ideas were fundamentally shaped before his return to India in 1915. It was during his years in England and South Africa that he came to understand the nature of imperialism and racism; and it was in South Africa that he forged the philosophy and techniques that would undermine and ultimately destroy the British Empire.    Based on a wealth of new material, and archival research in four continents, Gandhi Before India presents a vivid portrait of Gandhi and the world he lived in, a world of sharp contrasts between the coastal culture of Gujarat, High Victorian London, and colonial South Africa. It explores in rich detail his experiments with dissident cults such as Tolstoyans and vegetarians; his friendships with radical Jews, heterodox Christians, and devout Muslims; his enmities and rivalries; and his failures as a husband and father. It tells the dramatic, profoundly moving story of how he inspired the devotion of thousands of followers as he mobilized a cross-class and inter-religious coalition, pledged to non-violence in their battle against a brutally racist regime.   This deeply researched and beautifully written book will radically alter our understanding and appreciation of India’s greatest man.

Why did Norman Mailer stab his second wife at a party?  Who was Edith Wharton’s secret transatlantic lover? What motivated Anaïs Nin to become a bigamist?   Writers Between the Covers rips the sheets off these and other real-life love stories of the literati—some with fairy tale endings and others that resulted in break-ups, breakdowns, and brawls. Among the writers laid bare are Agatha Christie, who sparked the largest-ever manhunt in England as her marriage fell apart; Arthur Miller, whose jaw-dropping pairing with Marilyn Monroe proved that opposites attract, at least initially; and T.S.

"DUTY: MEMOIRS OF A SECRETARY AT WAR (hb) 2014","From the former secretary of defense, a strikingly candid, vividly written account of his experience serving Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Before Robert M. Gates received a call from the White House in 2006, he thought he’d left Washington politics behind: after working for six presidents in both the CIA and the National Security Council, he was happy in his role as president of Texas A&M University. But when he was asked to help a nation mired in two wars and to aid the troops doing the fighting, he answered what he felt was the call of duty. Now, in this unsparing memoir, meticulously fair in its assessments, he takes us behind the scenes of his nearly five years as a secretary at war: the battles with Congress, the two presidents he served, the military itself, and the vast Pentagon bureaucracy; his efforts to help Bush turn the tide in Iraq; his role as a guiding, and often dissenting, voice for Obama; the ardent devotion to and love for American soldiers—his “heroes”—he developed on the job.   In relating his personal journey as secretary, Gates draws us into the innermost sanctums of government and military power during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, illuminating iconic figures, vital negotiations, and critical situations in revealing, intimate detail. Offering unvarnished appraisals of Dick Cheney, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, and Presidents Bush and Obama among other key players, Gates exposes the full spectrum of behind-closed-doors politicking within both the Bush and Obama administrations.   He discusses the great controversies of his tenure—surges in both Iraq and Afghanistan,  how to deal with Iran and Syria, “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” Guantánamo Bay, WikiLeaks—as they played out behind the television cameras. He brings to life the Situation Room during the Bin Laden raid. And, searingly, he shows how congressional debate and action or inaction on everything from equipment budgeting to troop withdrawals was often motivated, to his increasing despair and anger, more by party politics and media impact than by members’ desires to protect our soldiers and ensure their success.   However embroiled he became in the trials of Washington, Gates makes clear that his heart was always in the most important theater of his tenure as secretary: the front lines. We journey with him to both war zones as he meets with active-duty troops and their commanders, awed by their courage, and also witness him greet coffin after flag-draped coffin returned to U.S. soil, heartbreakingly aware that he signed every deployment order. In frank and poignant vignettes, Gates conveys the human cost of war, and his admiration for those brave enough to undertake it when necessary.  Duty tells a powerful and deeply personal story that allows us an unprecedented look at two administrations and the wars that have defined them.  Author: Robert M. Gates served as secretary of defense from 2006 to 2011. He also served as an officer in the United States Air Force and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency before being appointed director of the agency by President George H. W. Bush. He was a member of the National Security Council staff in four administrations and served eight presidents of both political parties. Additionally, Gates has a continuing distinguished record in the private sector and in academia, including currently serving as chancellor of the College of William and Mary. He holds a Ph.D. in Russian and Soviet history from Georgetown University.

"COMPANY MAN: THIRTY YEARS OF CONTROVERSY AND CRISIS IN THE CIA (hb)","In 1975, fresh out of law school and working a numbing job at the Treasury Department, John Rizzo took “a total shot in the dark” and sent his résumé to the Central Intelligence Agency. He had no notion that more than thirty years later, after serving under eleven CIA directors and seven presidents, he would become a notorious public figure—a symbol and a victim of the toxic winds swirling in post-9/11 Washington. From serving as the point person answering for the Iran-contra scandal to approving the rules that govern waterboarding and other “enhanced interrogation techniques,” John Rizzo witnessed and participated in virtually all of the significant operations of the CIA’s modern history.  In Company Man, Rizzo charts the CIA’s evolution from shadowy entity to an organization exposed to new laws, rules, and a seemingly neverending string of public controversies. Rizzo offers a direct window into the CIA in the years after the 9/11 attacks, when he served as the agency’s top lawyer, with oversight of actions that remain the subject of intense debate today. In Company Man, Rizzo is the first CIA official to ever describe what “black sites” look like from the inside and he provides the most comprehensive account ever written of the “torture tape” fiasco surrounding the interrogation of Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaydah and the birth, growth, and death of the enhanced interrogation program.  Spanning more than three decades, Company Man is the most authoritative insider account of the CIA ever written—a groundbreaking, timely, and remarkably candid history of American intelligence.  Author: John Rizzo had a thirty-four-year career as a lawyer at CIA, culminating with seven years as the Agency’s chief legal officer. In the post-9/11 era, he helped create and implement the full spectrum of aggressive counterterrorist operations against Al Qaeda, including the so-called “enhanced interrogation program” and lethal strikes against the Al Qaeda leadership. Since retiring from the CIA, he has served as senior counsel at a Washington, D.C., law firm and is a visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution. He is a graduate of Brown University and George Washington University Law School.

"MASTER LASTER: WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT SACHIN TENDULKAR(pb)","There are almost as many books about Sachin Tendulkar as there are centuries by him. But, just as there is only one Tendulkar century that came in a winning run chase in the last innings of a Test match, rare are the books that look at his personal records through the prism of how much they mattered to the team. In fact there are none, because the easiest thing to do is to produce adulatory tomes for his doting fans. But there are an equal number of cricket fans out there who want to know something more than gushing accolades and who don't shy away from asking difficult questions. The book covers:   • A quarter of a century of Indian cricket, bringing back to life many a game played during Tendulkar’s time. • It indulges fans in one of the enduring joys of cricket, discussing a point threadbare from multiple angles. • How many of his centuries made a difference to the team? • What is his track record under pressure?  None of the books on Tendulkar has engaged fans in these debates. There is the odd question raised here or a critical comment made there in memoirs by former cricketers, but not a single book that sifts through the mountain of Tendulkar records to see what value can be attached to them from a team’s point of view. An exercise like that can be quite revealing, even startling, and certainly a lot of fun for cricket lovers. It sets the Tendulkar debate against specific data, taking it beyond career aggregates and passionate assertions.   Master Laster covers the variables in the game, and its infinite possibilities. It also deals with why this game is so fascinates so many of us.  Author: Sumit Chakraberty has worked as a journalist for over 30 years, with stints at Indian Express, The Times of India, BiTV, UTV and most recently, DNA, where he was the Sunday Editor and wrote a weekly cricket column aimed straight at the head, called Beamer.

"KANSHIRAM: LEADER OF THE DALITS (hb)","Venerated as a dalit icon, Kanshiram (1934 2006) is regarded as being next only to Ambedkar today. This book illuminates his journey, from the early years in rural Punjab and with Ambedkarites in Pune, to his launching BAMCEF, an umbrella organization uniting backward castes, scheduled tribes, dalits and minorities, and eventually the Bahujan Samaj Party in 1984.   Drawing on myriad oral and written sources, Badri Narayan shows how Kanshiram mobilized dalits with his homespun idiom, cycle rallies and, uniquely, the use of local folk heroes and myths, rousing their self-respect, and how he struck opportunistic alliances with higher-caste parties to seize power for dalits. Evocatively described is his extraordinary relationship with Mayawati, right until his death, and the role she has played in fulfilling his vision, during and after his lifetime.   Contrasting the approach of the two men, Narayan highlights the turn Kanshiram gave to Ambedkar s ideas. Unlike Ambedkar, who sought its annihilation, he saw caste as a basis for forging a dalit identity and a source of political empowerment.   Authoritative and insightful, this is a rare portrait of the man who changed the face of dalit society and, indeed, of Indian politics.  Author: Badri Narayan is a professor at the G.B.

"SACHIN TENDULKAR: PLAYING IT MY WAY (pb) 2014","The greatest run-scorer in the history of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar retired in 2013 after an astonishing 24 years at the top. The most celebrated Indian cricketer of all time, he received the Bharat Ratna Award—India's highest civilian honor—on the day of his retirement. Now Sachin Tendulkar tells his own remarkable story, from his first Test cap at the age of 16 to his 100th international century and the emotional final farewell that brought his country to a standstill. When a boisterous Mumbai youngster's excess energies were channeled into cricket, what resulted were record-breaking schoolboy batting exploits that launched the career of a cricketing phenomenon. Before long Sachin Tendulkar was the cornerstone of India's batting lineup, his every move watched by a cricket-mad nation's devoted followers. Never has a cricketer been burdened with so many expectations; never has a cricketer performed at such a high level for so long and with such style—scoring more runs and making more centuries than any other player, in both Tests and one-day games. And perhaps only one cricketer could have brought together a shocked nation by defiantly scoring a Test century shortly after terrorist attacks rocked Mumbai. His many achievements with India include winning the World Cup and topping the world Test rankings. Yet he has also known his fair share of frustration and failure, from injuries and early World Cup exits to stinging criticism from the press, especially during his unhappy tenure as captain. Despite his celebrity status, Sachin Tendulkar has always remained a very private man, devoted to his family and his country. Now, for the first time, he provides a fascinating insight into his personal life and gives a frank, revealing account of a sporting life like no other.

AMBEDKAR: SAVIOUR OF THE MASSES (pb)2014","The story of the father of the Indian Constitution Born in April 1891into a poor Mahar family, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was a victim of caste discrimination for most of his early life. And while India struggled against the oppressions of British Raj, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb, continued his struggle against the oppressions of the Indian caste system, the social discriminations against Dalits in India. He struggled so the underprivileged sections of Indian society could enjoy equal political rights and be treated with equal respect. An Indian jurist, politician, philosopher, anthropologist, historian and economist, Babasaheb was one of the earliest Dalit’s to earn a college degree. He grew to be the principal architect of Indian constitution. He published journals, periodicals, and launched active movements for social and political freedom for India’s Dalit community. Ambedkar, in the later years of his life, turned to Buddhism, preached it and finally made a formal conversion. This book explores the life and times of the independent India's first law minister who fought against the discriminations inflicted by his own countrymen, who lived his life acting only in the interest of people.

"THE RED SARI: A DRAMATIZED BIOGRAPHY OF SONIA GANDHI (pb) 2015","In the year 1965, Sonia Maino, a 19-year-old Italian student met a young Indian boy, Rajiv Gandhi, while they were both studying in Cambridge. She was born into a modest family in suburban Turin, where her father was a strict man who kept a close eye on his three daughters. Much to his chagrin, his painfully-shy middle daughter, of whom he was especially protective, fell in love with a man belonging the most powerful family in India. This marked the beginning of a story unlike any other-of a carefree Italian girl who was compelled to take on the murky world of rajneeti. With information sourced from close friends and colleagues, this book examines how Sonias courage, honesty and dedication have made her a leader in the eyes of one-sixth of humanity. From her idyllic childhood to her passionate love affair and from her days as a docile daughter-in-law to her current status of being the only Indian politician to have refused prime ministership - 'The Red Sari' tells the story of an extraordinary woman whose dreams of home, hearth and anonymous living were struck down by the hands of fate. This book examines the lives of the famous Nehru - Gandhi family set against the backdrop of the Bangladesh War, the Emergency, Operation Blue Star and other events that have shaped modern Indian history.

"COMMON GROUND (pb)","Justin Trudeau has spent his life in the public eye. From the moment he was born, the first son of an iconic prime minister and his young wife, Canadians have witnessed the highs and the lows, sharing in his successes and mourning with him during tragic times. But few beyond Justin's closest circle have heard his side of his unique journey. Now, in Common Ground, Justin Trudeau reveals how the events of his life have influenced him and formed the ideals that drive him today. He explores, with candour and empathy, the difficulties of his parents' marriage and the effect it had on a small boy and the close relationship with a father whose exacting standards were second only to his love for his sons. He explores his political coming of age during the tumultuous years of the Charlottetown Accord and the Quebec Referendum, and reflects on his time as a teacher, which was interrupted by the devastating losses of his brother and father. We hear how a connection was forged with a beautiful young woman, Sophie Gregoire, who had known the Trudeaus in earlier days. Through it all, we come to understand how Justin found his own voice as a young man and began to solidify his understanding of Canada's strengths and potential as a nation. We hear what drew Justin toward politics and what led to his decision to run for office. Through Justin's eyes, we see what it was like in those first days of seeking the Liberal nomination for Papineau, when it was just he and Sophie and a clipboard in a grocery store parking lot, and how hard work and determination won him not only the nomination but two hard-fought elections. We learn of his reaction to the considerable Liberal defeat in 2011 and how it clarified his belief that the Liberal Party had lost touch with Canadians-and how that summer he was far from considering a run for the Liberal leadership but contemplating whether to leave politics altogether. And we learn why, in the end, he decided to help rejuvenate the Liberal Party and to run for the leadership and for prime minister. But mostly, Justin shares with readers his belief that Canada is a country made strong by its diversity, not in spite of it, and how our greatest potential lies in finding what unites us, in building on a sense of shared purpose-our common hopes and dreams-and in coming together on common ground.  Author: Justin Trudeau  Justin Trudeau is the twice-elected Member of Parliament for Papineau and Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada. As a Parliamentarian, he has been Liberal Party Critic for Youth, Post-Secondary Education, Amateur Sport, Multiculturalism, Citizenship and Immigration, and sat on the House of Commons committees on the Environment and Sustainable Development, and Citizenship and Immigration. Prior to his role as an elected official, Trudeau was a teacher in British Columbia and an advocate for the environment and for youth, including four years as chair of Katimavik, Canada’s national youth service program. Trudeau was born on December 25, 1971, the eldest son of the late former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Margaret Sinclair Trudeau Kemper.

"STEVE JOBS: THE EXCLUSIVE BIOGRAPHY (pb)","Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years - as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues - this is the acclaimed, internationally bestselling biography of the ultimate icon of inventiveness. Walter Isaacson tells the story of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies,music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written, nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.  Author: Walter Isaacson, the CEO of the Aspen Institute, has been chairman of CNN and the managing editor of Time magazine. He is the author of Benjamin Franklin: An American Life and of Kissinger: A Biography, and the coauthor of The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made.

"CHARLES THE HEART OF KING","He has lived his whole life in the public eye, yet he remains an enigma. He was born to be king, but he aims much higher. A landmark publication, Charles: The Heart of a King reveals Prince Charles in all his complexity: the passionate views that mean he will never be as remote and impartial as his mother; the compulsion to make a difference and the many and startling ways in which the heir to the throne of the United Kingdom and fifteen other realms has already made his mark.  The book offers fresh and fascinating insights into the first marriage that did so much to define him and an assessment of his relationship with the woman he calls, with unintended accuracy, his 'dearest wife': Camilla. We see Charles as a father and a friend, a serious figure and a joker. Life at court turns out to be full of hidden dangers and unexpected comedy.   Poignant, funny and often surprising, the first significant study of the Prince in over a decade reveals a man in sight of happiness yet still driven by anguish and a remarkable belief system, a charitable entrepreneur, activist, agitator and avatar of the Establishment who just as often tilts against it.   Based on multiple interviews with his friends and courtiers, palace insiders and critics, and access to Charles himself during research lasting more than a year, this biography explores the Prince’s philanthropy and his compulsive interventionism, his faith, his political leanings and the philosophy that means when he seeks harmony he sometimes creates controversy.   Gripping, at times astonishing, often laugh-out-loud, this is a royal biography unlike any other.  by Catherine Mayer","PKR 1,095.00","CATHERINE MAYER",9780753555958,2016,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,Paperback,English,448,images/books/9780753555958.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780753555958&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

Today's criminals are stealing identities, draining online bank-accounts and wiping out computer servers. It's disturbingly easy to activate baby cam monitors to spy on families, pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt, and thieves are analyzing your social media in order to determine the best time for a home invasion.

"THE UNTOLD VAJPAYEE: POLITICIAN AND PARADOX (hb) 2016","Despite his grand secular statements in Parliament that bordered on the Nehruvian, Atal Bihari Vajpayee has often taken brief excursions into the hardline camp. In 1983, he made an incendiary speech during the Assam elections in which the presence of Bangladeshi foreigners in the state was a big issue. Even the BJP had disowned Vajpayee s speech, which possibly inspired the massacre of over 2000 people, mostly Muslims, in Nellie in Assam. Vajpayee, one of the shrewdest politicians of India, is known for negotiating multiple contradictions: from militant nationalism to his secret family life; his stint as a communist; his indulgence in food; influence of Gandhi and Nehru; Narendra Modi and Gujarat issues; foreign policies; and his attempt to project himself as a moderate face, if not liberal, among others. Exploring crucial milestones of Vajpayee s career and his traits as a seasoned politician, the book looks at his relationship with leaders of his party and the love hate association with RSS and its feeder organizations. Thoroughly researched, supported by hard facts and accompanied by inside stories and anecdotes, insightful interviews and archival photographs, The Untold Vajpayee would open a window to the life and times of a poet politician.

"TO LIGHT A CANDLE AND KEEP IT BURNING (hb)","This is my story, the story of a German who has up to now lived for more than forty years in Pakistan, and has been very happy in her work, and with her patients, friends and co-workers and who loves the laughter and the sadness and the courage of the people, the beauty and the threatening grandeur of the country, and has suffered a lot witnessing the injustice and the violence and disregard for the dignity of the weak and the poor, and tried and struggled to add her small contribution to the fight against the evil and to strengthen the many many good and brave initiatives. But of course I have seen it with the eyes of a Westerner. And as this book is a kind of an account of my life, there will be many passages strange to my Muslim friends. However, this may not necessarily be a negative point because this mutual inter-cultural enrichment, which characterizes the Leprosy Programme of Pakistan, has only been possible because we have shared, listened to and clarified our ways of thinking, making this cross fertilization possible. —Ruth Pfau   Author: Ruth Pfau ","PKR 495.00","RUTH PFAU",9789696373537,2017,"GENERAL INTEREST > BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES",1,"Hard Cover",English,246,images/books/9789696373537.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9789696373537&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"IF I AM ASSASSINATED (hb)","From his death cell in Rawalpindi, ousted Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto wrote his final testament. Under trial for authorizing the murder of a political opponent, Bhutto writes a scathing denunciation of military dictatorship, rebuts the allegations against his government made in General Zia-ul-Haq's White Paper, and hints at his greatest achievement: the then-covert founding of Pakistan's nuclear programme.   Bhutto predicts that, should his murder be permitted, the rivers of the Indus Valley will turn red with blood. Smuggled out of prison and published in neighbouring India, If I Am Assassinated continues to be the most controversial piece of political literature to have been written in Pakistan  “The people have realized that Martial Law is not law. A regime not established by law is devoid of the attribute to dispense law. A regime which puts in a bunker the highest law in the land does not have the moral authority to say that nobody is above the law.”   “The sanction of force stands behind the medley of personal orders and regulations of Martial Law. The sanction of the people's consent stands behind the hierarchy of laws. In one situation, the population is regimented into acquiescence. In the other, the population voluntarily establishes a contract with Parliament. For this reason, one is called a regime and the other, a government. Martial law rests on the sanction of force and not on the sanction of law.”   ?

"THE HOME THAT WAS OUR COUNTRY: A MEMOIR OF SYRIA (pb)","Alia Malek weaves a lyrical narrative around the history of her family's apartment building in the heart of Damascus, the many lives that crossed in the stairwell, and how the fates of her neighbors reflect the fate of her country.  At the Arab Spring's hopeful start, Alia Malek returned to Damascus to reclaim her grandmother's apartment, which had been lost to her family since Hafez al-Assad came to power in 1970. Its loss was central to her parent's decision to make their lives in America. In chronicling the people who lived in the Tahaan building, past and present, Alia portrays the Syrians-the Muslims, Christians, Jews, Armenians, and Kurds-who worked, loved, and suffered in close quarters, mirroring the political shifts in their country. Restoring her family's home as the country comes apart, she learns how to speak the coded language of oppression that exists in a dictatorship, while privately confronting her own fears about Syria's future.  The Home That Was Our Country is a deeply researched, personal journey that shines a delicate but piercing light on Syrian history, society, and politics. Teeming with insights, the narrative weaves acute political analysis with a century of intimate family history, ultimately delivering an unforgettable portrait of the Syria that is being erased.  Author: Alia Malek Alia Malek is an award-winning journalist and civil rights lawyer. She is the author of A Country Called Amreeka and editor of Patriot Acts and EUROPA.

"IF BORN AGAIN... (hb)","A truly engrossing book whose premise is a hypothetical question, the title of the book — If Born Again. The first book of its kind, which attempts to bring together high achievers and inspiring people from India and Pakistan — the two great nations, struggling to achieve a lasting relationship of trust and peace, even after a long period of seven decades. Fluttering through their childhood fantasies, relating anecdotes from their eventful lives, this book has some truly remarkable quotes from those interviewed.  Highly imaginative questions put to these personalities, famous in their own world of human domain that they represent, has resulted in responses, which are really very distinctive and heartfelt. The narratives which emerge, if taken together, lead to one message conveyed by all — the message of love and harmony. All the twenty-two outstanding individuals interviewed are bonded by the cord of humanity. The arc of history favours those that courageously stand steadfast against the darkness of enmity to welcome a new dawn of friendship. This book serves to contribute in that great endeavour to build bridges across man-made chasms of separation and despair.

"THE HOPE CIRCUIT: A PSYCHOLOGIST'S JOURNEY FROM HELPLESSNESS TO OPTIMISM (hb)","One of the most influential living psychologists looks at the history of his life and discipline, and paints a much brighter future for everyone.  When Martin E. P. Seligman first encountered psychology in the 1960s, the field was devoted to eliminating misery: it was the science of how past trauma creates present symptoms. Today, thanks in large part to Seligman’s Positive Psychology movement, it is ever more focused not on what cripples life, but on what makes life worth living–with profound consequences for our mental health.  In this wise and eloquent memoir, spanning the most transformative years in the history of modern psychology, Seligman recounts how he learned to study optimism–including a life-changing conversation with his five-year-old daughter. He tells the human stories behind some of his major findings, like CAVE, an analytical tool that predicts election outcomes (with shocking accuracy) based on the language used in campaign speeches, the international spread of Positive Education, the launch of the US Army’s huge resilience program, and the canonical studies that birthed the theory of learned helplessness–which he now reveals was incorrect. And he writes at length for the first time about his own battles with depression at a young age.  In The Hope Circuit, Seligman makes a compelling and deeply personal case for the importance of virtues like hope, gratitude, and wisdom for our mental health. You will walk away from this book not just educated but deeply enriched.  ","PKR 2,995.00","MARTIN E. P.

"BECOMING (hb)","An intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States.  In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America-the first African-American to serve in that role-she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.  In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her-from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world's most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it-in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations-and whose story inspires us to do the same.

"AGA SEAFOOD COOKBOOK, THE (hb)2005","The very first Aga seafood cookbook. Mitchell Tonks, writing in his introduction to The Aga Seafood Cookbook: ‘The Aga is fantastically versatile when it comes to cooking seafood. I really love just being able to open the lids, throw pieces of seafood on the top and cook them to perfection in just a few minutes. I love the moistness of roasted monkfish tail cooked “just so” in the roasting oven. And it’s great that a rich shellfish and tomato stew can slowly cook in the top of the simmering oven, gently bringing out the wonderful rich flavours from the shells of the crustacea.’ It is his trailblazing approach to cooking seafood that has made Mitchell Tonks a household name amongst seafood lovers. Now, as the proud possessor of a new black four-oven Aga, Mitchell has written a wonderful seafood book for all Aga owners. A book full of recipes that reflect his philosophy that cooking should be a source of enjoyment, not drudgery. His food, and this book, is unashamedly about absolute freshness, seasonality, simplicity and above all flavour. Featuring over 75 seafood recipes for the Aga, The Aga Seafood Cookbook, is a long awaited addition to the shelves of fish-loving Aga cooks the world over.","PKR 495.00","MITCHELL TONKS",1904573258,2005,"GENERAL INTEREST > COOKERY",1,"Hard Cover",English,176,images/books/1904573258.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=1904573258&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

Santhi Balaraman, however, believes that our traditional recipes, time-tested by our elders, are tasty, healthy and nutritious, and because of modern gadgets and kitchen facilities, the time spent in preparing these Recipes has decreased, becoming less of a chore. Based on these ideas she has attempted to revive 200 traditional recipes from the four Southern states of India, for all meals and occasions. Beautifully presented, and simply explained, these mouth-watering recipes will appeal as much to the beginner as to the seasoned cook.   Santhi Balaraman is well known in South India for her Cookery shows. She runs a company called Chaturmukhi Production and hosted a popular cookery show on Sun TV. She has written a number of cookbooks in Tamil and has cookery columns in both English and Tamil Magazines to her credit. She holds live cookery contests and Quizzes and also replies to viewer queries on FM AIR. She believes that cookery is both a Science and an art.

"SUPER FRESH JUICES & SMOOTHIES (hb)","Along with the nutrients gleaned from fresh fruit and vegetables, these great-tasting drinks contain the added benefit of active super-nutrients such as spirulina, wheatgrass, maca, baobab, lacuma, acai berries, chia seeds, and raw cacao among many others. To help those unfamiliar with these super-nutrients, an in-depth list with a detailed explanation of their numerous health benefits is featured as well as information on how to use them. There is no comparison between home-produced juices and storebought ones from a health point of view; with homemade drinks you know what you’re getting, you can choose your favorite fresh produce and they are additive-free with no added sugar and they’re not pasteurized, a process which can deplete their nutritional status. Alongside over 100 recipes, this book gives valuable practical advice on getting the most from your fresh produce, including shopping tips, covering seasonality and foraging, plus a guide to buying a juicer or blender that best suits your needs.

"BREAKFAST FOR DINNER (hb)","Morning favorites get jazzed up and dressed for dinner.  Morning favorites get jazzed up and dressed for dinner.  Cooking traditional morning-time meals for dinner feels decadent. You’re daring to be different. It's 8pm and you could cobble together an uninspiring chilli con carne, like you do most Wednesdays. Or you could make what you really want—like you did before conformity came along with its sensible shoes and traditional meal times. While you’re there, why not why not jazz it up a little? You’re a rule breaker, after all.   In Eggs Just The Way You Like Them, you’ll find nostalgic classics like Betty Grable Eggs (with a twist of course), but what you didn’t expect was a truly outrageous indulgence like New Orleans Benedict, which has to be tried to be believed. Try the super-trendy Fried Game Hen and Cornmeal Waffles or if you’re a sweet with savoury fan, why not break out the Monte Cristo from Hot Sandwiches & Savoury Waffles. Discover Pulled Pork Hash and Hash Browns 3 Ways from Skillet Suppers, while Brinner in a Bowl will take you on a journey from east and west, from a spicy Nasi Goreng to a Caribbean Trini Saltfish Buljol. Tuck in to popular sweet and savoury pancake recipes in From the Griddle with Chicks in Blankets and Blueberry Cotton Candy Pancakes.   Why not whip up a sensational bake from The Pastry Basket, such as Bacon-butterscotch Cinnamon Rolls and Raspberry Coffee Cake. Last but not least, get on board with a Brunch Punch, an Espresso Martini or Coffee Granita from Cocktails, Coffees, & other Hot Beverages. You’re in for a treat.

Are you sometimes tempted to write the word utilize instead of use, or albeit when but will do?  For anyone who has ever found written English a potential minefield of disasters, Mind the Gaffe will help you avoid the blunders and howlers which could leave your readers either bemused or rolling on the floor with laughter.  In this straight-talking and highly entertaining book, Larry Trask gives forthright advice on how to write simply and effectively, highlighting pretentious words that should be avoided at all costs (synergy, interface, feedback …); suggesting guidelines for the use of e-mail; and adjudicating on hundreds of contentious issues, from split infinitives to whether you should write napkin or serviette.

"BETTER SPOKEN ENGLISH (pb)2007","This book is eminently practical. It sets out to offer students in India an achievable approach to improve their spoken English at the tertiary level. It is original in a number of ways: In the first place, it makes the very important distinction between what is essential (‘core’) for intelligibility and what is relatively unimportant (‘peripheral’). All too often in the past, courses in pronunciation have aimed at an unachievable and illusory ‘native speaker’ competence. In doing so, students have wasted a great deal of time and effort on inessentials and have all too often experienced unnecessary feelings of inferiority into the bargain. Every variety of English, including the many accents and dialects of the British Isles and North America, ‘deviates’ from the ‘ideal’ – which is in fact no more than an ‘idea’. What is important to concentrate on the key features and to avoid speech habits which impede understanding. The emphasis of Better Spoken English is effective communication. This book is designed to help you achieve greater fluency in English.  • Numerous drills to enable better understanding  • Avoids phonetics  • End of chapter exercises with answers  • Concentrates on features of connected speech: Stress, Intonation, Phrasing and Pauses  Author: Shreesh Chaudhary","PKR 750.00","SHREESH CHAUDHARY",9788125915331,2007,"GENERAL INTEREST > ENGLISH LANGUAGE",1,Paperback,English,238,images/books/9788125915331.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9788125915331&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"COMMON MISTAKES IN ENGLISH (pb)","This book has been created specially to deal in detail with the common errors committed by the students and laymen in their writing and speech. It, being so comprehensive, may be used very profitably as a reference book both by the students and the teachers. It is primarily meant for the students to help them learn principles of everyday usage which often pose problems. It aims at giving the readers a proper and in-depth understanding of correct and good English which consists of spellings, usage, idioms, phrases, construction, punctuation, etc. The various chapters on common mistakes in this book are not presented in any graded order. Therefore, it is not necessary to study them in their order given here. But apply your mind while going through it, mere reading is o enough. A careful and thorough study of these chapters is bound to help you considerably in avoiding common errors committed in everyday life.   Students commit mistakes repeatedly, for they are not familiar with the norms of writing correct and good English. Correct writing is not an end in itself, but a means to better self-expression and social communication. Correct writing is not synonymous with writing, but the former certainly helps in the achievement of the latter. It is hoped that this Practical Guide to Common mistakes, with so much basic and functional solutions, will aid you in possessing better skills and improve language abilities without the help of the teacher.

For over a quarter of a century, as creator and proprietor of the National Grammar Hot Line, he helped thousands of callers from every corner of the globe tackle the thorniest issues of English grammar. Now, in The Grammar Bible, he has created an eminently useful guide to better speaking and writing. Unlike other grammar manuals, The Grammar Bible is driven by the actual questions Professor Strumpf encountered during his years of teaching and fielding phone calls from anxious writers, conscientious students, and perplexed editors, including such perennial quandaries as o Where do I put this comma? o What case should this pronoun be in? o How do I form the possessive of Dickens? Professor Strumpf explains these and other language issues with wit and wisdom, showing how to speak more clearly and write more impressively by avoiding common errors and following the principles of good grammar. Whether you need a comprehensive review of the subjunctive mood or simply want to know which form of a verb to use, The Grammar Bible is a practical guide that will enlighten, educate, and entertain.  About the Author Michael Strumpf organized the National Grammar Hot Line while a professor of English at Moorpark College. He has appeared on Oprah and Today and serves as grammatical consultant to major corporations and governmental bodies.

"THE GREAT COURSES: BUILDING GREAT SENTENCES: HOW TO WRITE THE KINDS OF SENTENCES YOU LOVE TO READ(pb)","Based on the bestselling series from The Great Courses, Building Great Sentences celebrates the sheer joy of language—and will forever change the way you read and write.   Great writing begins with the sentence. Whether it’s two words (“Jesus wept.”) or William Faulkner’s 1,287-word sentence in Absalom! Absalom!, sentences have the power to captivate, entertain, motivate, educate, and, most importantly, delight. Yet, the sentence-oriented approach to writing is too often overlooked in favor of bland economy. Building Great Sentences teaches you to write better sentences by luxuriating in the pleasures of language.   Award-winning Professor Brooks Landon draws on examples from masters of long, elegant sentences—including Don DeLillo, Virginia Woolf, Joan Didion, and Samuel Johnson—to reveal the mechanics of how language works on thoughts and emotions, providing the tools to write powerful, more effective sentences.

"ENGLISH FOR TEACHING (FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS) (pb)","Realizing the importance of English in a globalized economy, many schools have introduced it as a compulsory language at the early level. Some states have also relented to the pressure from various quarters and introduced English as a medium of instruction at school level. With a rise in the trend, schools are grappling with the issue of enhancing their teachers’ proficiency in English to cope with the new situation.   English for Teaching addresses the language needs of in-service teachers and pre-service teacher trainees at the secondary level. With the twin objective of improving language proficiency and enhancing teachers’ understanding of pedagogy, the book adopts the loop-input approach.

"REVISITING SECOND LANGUAGE MATERIALS: A PAKISTANI PERSPECTIVE (hb)","Language materials are tools (such as texts, activities and complete textbooks) utilized for language learning; in fact, the degree of language acquisition is largely dependent on the types of materials used in the classrooms. Thus language materials have been an important focus of literature in the past two decades. “Many of the books published are ‘how to’ books… but they are not based on research studies into materials” (Garton and Graves, 2014: 1). In contrast, this book presents a fresh outlook about the field of second language materials by illustrating and applying the theoretical assumptions in research involving comprehensive analysis of the ESL textbook scenario in Pakistan for the first time. The opening chapters encapsulate the concepts focusing on materials and other related areas and specify the practices deemed to be effective for second language learning. The main chapters discuss the findings highlighted through a recent study critically investigating the different educational aspects (primarily the textbooks) which have influenced the English language teaching context in Pakistan.  This book is relevant for practitioners and students associated with the fields of ELT, TEFL, TESOL, applied linguistics, and education as well as educational policy makers, English language teachers, and English language textbook writers in Pakistan and abroad.  Author: Dr. Asma Aftab has a PhD in Applied English Linguistics from University of Birmingham, UK. She has taught English language to different levels for 15 years in Pakistan and has been training English language teachers for the past 8 years in Kinnaird College for Women, Lahore, Pakistan. Her specialized areas include language materials development and teaching methodology.","PKR 995.00","ASMA AFTAB",9789696372912,2017,"GENERAL INTEREST > ENGLISH LANGUAGE",1,"Hard Cover",English,377,images/books/9789696372912.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9789696372912&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"RUSSIAN MADE EASY WITH AUDIO CD (hb)","Goodwill's Russian Made Easy is an elementary level course for those who want to learn the Russian language from scratch in an easy and systematic manner. The book starts from teaching the alphabet, moving to explaining the various rules of grammar, and providing dialogues suitable for various occasions and situations. Grammar rules have been supplemented with relevant exercises to make grammatical concepts clear to the readers. Learning a language does not include only reading and writing it, but it also encompasses speaking it fluently. When learning the language at home without any professional help, it becomes challenging to learn the correct pronunciation. To resolve this concern, this book comes with an audio CD to help the readers learn how to pronounce and speak the language in the right manner. It would certainly accelerate their learning process and grow their confidence while conversing in Russian. The book and the CD constitute a complete pack to learn Russian in methodical manner and at an affordable price. We hope that teachers, students and general readers will find this combo pack useful.

"LEARN CHINESE WITH ME VOL. 2 STUDENT'S BOOK (ENGLISH AND CHINESE EDITION) 2e(pb)","Since being published in 2003 by the People’s Education Press, Learn Chinese with Me has been widely used by language students as well as by language instructors. In 2014, with the assistance of the Hanban (Confucius Institute Headquarters), People’s Education Press has produced the second edition of the Learn Chinese with Me series to keep up with the changing times.  1. Throughout the entire revision process, we have attempted to make the series more generalizable to students of Chinese all around the world, as well as more suitable for our target demographic of high school students. While the original edition was mainly directed at students in North America, this edition aims to suit students from many different world regions. Additionally, many teachers advised us that, while the first edition of Learn Chinese with Me was a high school series, the content was more suited to younger students. We have industriously worked to address this tendency in the current edition and make the content more suitable for high school students outside of China.  2. We keep “decreasing content” as our principle of revision. Specifically, to relieve the teaching pressure, we have compressed each volume by about 20%. To decrease the difficulty of the material and better suit the requirements of  both  the  International Curriculum for Chinese Language Education and the HSK, we have adjusted text and added grammar sections. To make the material more interesting, we have designed new classroom activities and group practice assignments. We have also revised and supplemented existing sections, such as the explanation and teaching of pinyin, the teaching of Chinese characters and vocabulary, and the introduction of certain aspects of Chinese culture.  3. We have added a moderate amount of new material and kept our eyes on HSK tests. We have supplemented certain sections to help teachers prepare lessons. As many teachers mentioned that the first edition lacked adequate explanations of grammar patterns, the revised student edition of Learn Chinese with Me includes simple English introductions to new grammar patterns in order to help students understand them more easily. Additionally, the revised teacher’s book once more includes more detailed and developed explanations as well as class preparation materials. We have also increased the length of the content in the teacher’s book. Under the heading “Teaching Suggestions,” we have designed “Teaching Schedules”. In order to better match the format of the HSK, from the first volume’s second unit onward, we have added a practice set of HSK questions in every unit of the teacher’s book. These will help students become familiar with the HSK question format and allow them to review how far they have progressed.

"COMPLETE PRACTICAL GUIDE TO PATIO, TERRACE, BACKYARD AND COURTYARD GARDENING (hb)2010","This beautiful and practical new book is packed with creative ideas for making a successful outside courtyard space. The courtyard is typically an open area surrounded by walls or buildings, and can range from a tiny backyard, an urban terrace or patio area with small-scale gardening, to a more expansively sized area of garden with defined borders.   An introductory section gives advice on assessing a site, freshening up existing tired elements and basic planting techniques. Successive chapters on Traditional Lines, Mediterranean Moods, Outdoor Rooms, Productive Spaces, Contemplative Retreats and Contemporary Spaces each look at flooring, walls and screens, plants and containers, ornament and water features, and lighting. Inspirational examples of garden locations are presented, alongside step-by-step methods to explain some of the techniques and features shown.   Enclosed outside spaces have tremendous design potential, but require a disciplined approach so that the elements used link fluidly to each other. Each chapter includes a case study with a detailed colour plan explaining the dynamics of the different designed spaces, and describing how specific elements were achieved, such as building a slate path or producing a wall stencil. The structure of the book is highly adaptable so that you can use the practical design ideas within the named style, or mix and match, adapt and develop them to give a personal interpretation.   The plant directory gives a comprehensive listing of planting options, each entry complete with propagation, growth patterns, and ideal conditions. The final section on maintenance shows how to keep your courtyard looking its best, including deadheading, watering techniques and repainting fencing and trellis.  Over 800 stunning photographs and helpful illustrated garden plans and diagrams make this beautiful book both an inspired armchair read and a practical how-to manual.

"PEN. C: THE TURN OF THE SCREW THE ASPERN PAPERS (pb)","The apparition had reached the landing half-way up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window where, at the sight of me, it stopped short’  Oscar Wilde called James’s chilling The Turn of the Screw ‘a most wonderful, lurid poisonous little tale’. It tells of a young governess sent to a country house to take charge of two orphans, Miles and Flora. Unsettled by a sense of intense evil within the house, she soon becomes obsessed with the belief that something malevolent is stalking the children in her care. Obsession of a more worldly variety lies at the heart of The Aspern Papers, the tale of a literary historian determined to get his hands on some letters written by a great poet – and prepared to use trickery and deception to achieve his aims. Both show James’s mastery of the short story and his genius for creating haunting atmosphere and unbearable tension.   Anthony Curtis’s wide-ranging introduction traces the development of the two stories from initial inspiration to finished work and examines their critical reception.

"PEN. C: SENSE AND SENSIBILITY (pb)","‘The more I know of the world the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much!’  Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willougby she ignores her sister Elinor’s warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love – and its threatened loss – the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.  This edition also includes explanatory notes, textual variants between first and second edition, and Tony Tanner’s introduction to the original Penguin Classic edition.

Soon afterwards, a number of disturbing incidents unfold in England: an unmanned ship is wrecked at Whitby; strange puncture marks appear on a young woman’s neck; and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the imminent arrival of his ‘Master’. In the ensuing battle of wits between the sinister Count Dracula and a determined group of adversaries, Bram Stoker created a masterpiece of the horror genre, probing deeply into questions of human identity and sanity, and illuminating dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire.  For this completely updated edition, Maurice Hindle has revised his introduction, list of further reading and textual notes, and added two new appendices: Stoker’s essay on censorship and his interview with Winston Churchill, both published in 1908. Christopher Frayling’s preface discusses Stoker’s significance and the influences that contributed to his creation of the Dracula myth.

His fate, and that of the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past.

"PEN. C: THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (pb)","Set at the time of the Jacobite uprising, The Master of Ballantrae tells of a family divided. James Durie, Master of Ballantrae, abandons his ancestral home to support the Scottish rebellion - leaving his younger brother Henry, who is faithful to the English crown, to inherit the title of Lord Durrisdeer. But he is to return years later, embittered by battles and a savage life of piracy on the high seas, to demand his inheritance. Turning the people against the Lord, he begins a savage feud with his brother that will lead the pair from the Scottish Highlands to the American Wilderness. Satanic and seductive, the Master was regarded by Stevenson as all I know of the devil'; his darkly manipulative schemes dominate this subtle and compelling tragedy. This edition takes as its text the Edinburgh Edition of the novel, the last approved by the author. The introduction considers the novel's inspiration and its place as one of Stevenson's greatest studies in cruelty.

"PEN.

She is delighted with her new acquaintances: flirtatious Isabella, who introduces Catherine to the joys of Gothic romances, and sophisticated Henry and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to their father’s house, Northanger Abbey. There, influenced by novels of horror and intrigue, Catherine comes to imagine terrible crimes committed by General Tilney, risking the loss of Henry’s affection, and must learn the difference between fiction and reality, false friends and true. With its broad comedy and irrepressible heroine, Northanger Abbey is the most youthful and optimistic of Jane Austen’s works.

"PEN. C: ROBINSON CRUSOE (pb)","‘A raging wave, mountain-like, came rowling a-stern of us … we were all swallowed up in a moment’  The sole survivor of a shipwreck, Robinson Crusoe is washed up on a desert island. In his journal he chronicles his daily battle to stay alive, as he conquers isolation, fashions shelter and clothes, first encounters another human being and fights off cannibals and mutineers. With Robinson Crusoe, Defoe wrote what is regarded as the first English novel, and created one of the most popular and enduring myths in literature. Written in an age of exploration and enterprise, it has been variously interpreted as an embodiment of British imperialist values, as a portrayal of ‘natural man’, or as a moral fable. But above all it is a brilliant narrative, depicting Crusoe’s transformation from terrified survivor to self-sufficient master of his island.  This edition contains a full chronology of Defoe’s life and times, explanatory notes, glossary and a critical introduction discussing Robinson Crusoe as a pioneering work of modern psychological realism.

C: A TALE OF TWO CITIES (pb)","Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; – the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!’  After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille the aging Dr Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil lanes of London, they are all drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror and soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.  This edition uses the text as it appeared in its first serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens’s vision, and includes the original illustrations by H. K. Browne (‘Phiz’).

"PEN. C: THE STRANGE CASE OF DR.JEKYLL AND MR.HYDE AND OTHER TALES (pb)2003","He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp … his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and alter’  Published as a ‘shilling shocker’, Robert Louis Stevenson’s dark psychological fantasy gave birth to the idea of the split personality. The story of respectable Dr Jekyll’s strange association with ‘damnable young man’ Edward Hyde; the hunt through fog-bound London for a killer; and the final revelation of Hyde’s true identity is a chilling exploration of humanity’s basest capacity for evil. The other stories in this volume also testify to Stevenson’s inventiveness within the gothic genre: ‘Olalla’, a tale of vampirism and tainted family blood, and ‘The Body Snatcher’, a gruesome fictionalization of the exploits of the notorious Burke and Hare.  This edition contains a critical introduction by Robert Mighall, which discusses class, criminality and the significance of the story’s London setting. It also includes an essay on the scientific contexts of the novel and the development of the idea of the ‘Jekyll-and-Hyde’ personality.

"PEN. C: DISCOURSE ON METHOD AND RELATED WRITINGS (pb)","It is not enough to have a good mind; it is more important to use it well René Descartes was a central figure in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. In his Discourse on Method he outlined the contrast between mathematics and experimental sciences, and the extent to which each one can achieve certainty. Drawing on his own work in geometry, optics, astronomy and physiology, Descartes developed the hypothetical method that characterizes modern science, and this soon came to replace the traditional techniques derived from Aristotle. Many of Descartes’ most radical ideas—such as the disparity between our perceptions and the realities that cause them—have been highly influential in the development of modern philosophy. This edition sets the Discourse on Method in the wider context of Descartes’ work, with the Rules for Guiding One’s Intelligence in Searching for the Truth (1628), extracts from The World (1633) and selected letters from 1636-9. A companion volume, Meditations and Other Metaphysical Writings, is also published in Penguin Classics.

"PEN. C: EMMA (pb)","Beautiful, clever, rich - and single - Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protégée Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected. With its imperfect but charming heroine and its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, Emma is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work.   This edition includes a new chronology, additional suggestions for further reading, and the original Penguin Classics introduction by Tony Tanner.

The tale rapidly moves away from the narrative of travel to become a series of pathetic and ironic incidents, dramatic sketches, philosophical musings, and anecdotes. Here, sharp wit is mixed with gaiety, irony with tender feeling forging a truly original style and establishing Sterne as the first of the stream-of-consciousness writers.

"PEN. C: FAUST PART I (pb)","Goethe's Faust reworks the late-medieval myth of Dr Faust, a brilliant scholar so disillusioned he resolves to make a contract or wager with the devil, Mephistopheles. The devil will do all he asks on Earth and seek to grant him a moment in life so glorious that he will wish it to last for ever. But if Faust does bid the moment stay, he falls to Mephisto and must serve him after death. In this first part of Goethe's great work the embittered thinker and Mephistopheles enter into their agreement, and soon Faust is living a life beyond his study and - in rejuvenated form - winning the love of the charming and beautiful Gretchen. But in this compelling tragedy of arrogance, unfulfilled desire and self-delusion, Faust, served by the devil, heads inexorably towards destruction.

Soon the whole of human civilisation is under threat, as powerful Martians build gigantic killing machines, destroy all in their path with black gas and burning rays, and feast on the warm blood of trapped, still-living human prey.

"PEN. C: SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (pb)","One of the greatest works of the Middle Ages, in a marvelous new verse translation. Composed in the fourteenth century, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is as beloved as it is venerable, combining the hallmarks of medieval romance-pageantry, chivalry, and courtly love-with the charm of fairy tales and heroic sagas.   When a mysterious green knight rides on horseback into King Arthur's court, interrupting a New Year's feast, he issues a challenge: if any of King Arthur's men can behead him and he survives, then a year later he is entitled to return the strike. Sir Gawain takes up the challenge and decapitates the green knight, only to see him pick up his severed head and ride away, leaving Gawain to seek him out to fulfill their pact. Blending Celtic myth and Christian faith, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a Middle English masterpiece of magic, chivalry, and seduction.

When Mr. Dashwood dies, he must leave the bulk of his estate to the son by his first marriage, which leaves his second wife and three daughters (Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret) in straitened circumstances. They are taken in by a kindly cousin, but their lack of fortune affects the marriageability of both practical Elinor and romantic Marianne. When Elinor forms an attachment for the wealthy Edward Ferrars, his family disapproves and separates them. And though Mrs. Jennings tries to match the worthy (and rich) Colonel Brandon to her, Marianne finds the dashing and fiery Willoughby more to her taste. Both relationships are sorely tried. But this is a romance, and through the hardships and heartbreak, true love and a happy ending will find their way for both the sister who is all sense and the one who is all sensibility.

When Lenina and Bernard visit a savage reservation, we experience how Utopia can destroy humanity.A powerful work of speculative fiction that has enthralled and terrified readers for generations, Brave New World is both a warning to be heeded and thought-provoking yet satisfying entertainment.

"PEN. C: KING SOLOMON'S MINES (pb)","When first published, King Solomon's Mines (1885) was an enormous popular success. The narrative follows the explorations of Allan Quatermain, a fortune hunter who travels to Africa in search of ancient treasures and a lost fellow explorer. Written as an adventure story, the novel is also a late-Victorian imperial romance that illuminates the politics of British imperialist capitalism in 1870s and 1880s South Africa.  This edition includes contemporary reviews, other writings by Haggard on Africa and romance, and documents focusing on imperialism and diamond mining in late nineteenth-century South Africa.  In the 1880's in southern Africa, Allan Quatermain, a hunter and guide, joins forces with a sea captain and an English nobleman to find the latter's missing brother, who disappeared while searching for King Solomon's legendary lost diamond mines.   Author:  H. Rider Haggard (1856–1925) was bet by his brother that he could not write as good a novel as Stevenson's Treasure Island. The result of this bet was Haggard's 1885 book, King Solomon's Mines. It became a runaway bestseller, so that Haggard was able to leave London and concentrate on his writing.   ","PKR 425.00","H.

Beautiful, impulsive and spirited, Bathsheba Everdene's fortunes are changed forever when she inherits her own farm and becomes a woman of independent means. Set in Hardy's evocative Wessex countryside, Bathsheba is pursued by three very different suitors. The reliable and humble Gabriel Oak, the vain and impetuous Troy and the reserved yet determined Boldwood. With the morals of rural society weighing heavily upon her, it is through these relationships that Bathsheba experiences the torture of unrequited love and betrayal and discovers how random acts of chance and tragedy can alter the pathway of a life dramatically.

In Hard Times, the social and moral purpose of his work is at its most evident. Openly ironic and satirical in its tone, Dickens suggests a mechanization of society, where the wealthy are ruthless and uncharitable towards those less fortunate than themselves. Siblings Louisa and Tom Gradgrind are raised by their father, a harsh and pragmatic educator and his influence means that they go on to lead lives that are lacking in all areas. Louisa marries the arrogant and greedy Josiah Bounderby, ending in an unhappy pairing and the unfeeling and villainous Tom robs his own brother-in-law,s bank. As their father watches their plight, he realises that his own principles may have led to their downfall.  About the Author  Charles Dickens was born in 1812 and grew up in poverty.

We're their slaves as long as we can work; we pile up their fortunes with the sweat of our brows, and yet we are to live as separate as if we were in two worlds’  Based in the industrial unrest of 1840s Manchester, Mary Barton is a factory-worker's daughter living a working-class life in Victorian England.

One thing is certain, - that there is a mustering among the masses, the world over; and there is a dis irae coming on, sooner or later.’  Viewed by many as fuelling the abolitionist movement of the 1850s and laying the groundwork for the Civil War, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s sentimental and moral tale of slaves attempting to secure their freedom was one of the most popular books of the nineteenth century.

"COLLINS CLASSICS: THE ART OF RHETORIC (pb)","Despite dating from the 4th century BC, The Art of Rhetoric continues to be regarded by many as the single most important work on the art of persuasion. As democracy began emerging in 5th-century Athens, public speaking and debate became an increasingly important tool to garner influence in the assemblies, councils, and law courts of ancient Greece. In response to this, both politicians and ordinary citizens became desperate to learn greater skills in this area, as well as the philosophy behind it. This treatise was one of the first to provide just that, establishing methods and observations of informal reasoning and style, and has continued to be hugely influential on public speaking and philosophy today.  Aristotle, the grandfather of philosophy, student of Plato, and teacher of Alexander the Great, was one of the first people to create a comprehensive system of philosophy, encompassing logic, morality, aesthetics, politics, ethics, and science. Although written over 2,000 years ago, The Art of Rhetoric remains a comprehensive introduction for philosophy students into the subject of rhetoric, as well as a useful manual for anyone today looking to improve their oratory skills of persuasion.

"COLLINS CLASSICS: THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON AND TALES OF THE JAZZ AGE","From Collins Classics, short stories from the author of 'The Great Gatsby' and including 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'. In these eleven stories, Fitzgerald depicts the Roaring Twenties as he lived them. He masterfully blends accounts of flappers and the smart set with more fantastical visions of America, always imbuing his narratives with his trademark themes of money, class, ambition and love. In 'May Day', Fitzgerald weaves an account of a raucous Yale alumni party, the participants of which are oblivious to the violent socialist demonstration being acted out around them. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is an unorthodox account of a man who ages backwards, and 'The Diamond as Big as the Ritz' tells the story of a young man who discovers that his friend's family possesses a diamond that is literally larger than the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. This 1922 collection confirmed Fitzgerald as the voice of his generation.  Biography F. Scott Fitzgerald was one of the major American writers of the twentieth century -- a figure whose life and works embodied powerful myths about our national dreams and aspirations. Fitzgerald was talented and perceptive, gifted with a lyrical style and a pitch-perfect ear for language. He lived his life as a romantic, equally capable of great dedication to his craft and reckless squandering of his artistic capital. He left us one sure masterpiece, The Great Gatsby; a near-masterpiece, Tender Is the Night; and a gathering of stories and essays that together capture the essence of the American experience. His writings are insightful and stylistically brilliant; today he is admired both as a social chronicler and a remarkably gifted artist. ","PKR 265.00","F.

"COLLINS CLASSICS: THE BEAUTIFUL AND DAMNED (pb)","From Collins Classics and the author of 'The Great Gatsby' - now a major film - comes this razor-sharp satire on the excesses of the Jazz Age. From the author of The Great Gatsby, a tale of marriage and disappointment in the Roaring Twenties. Fitzgerald's rich and detailed novel of the decadent Jazz Era follows the beautiful and vibrant Anthony Patch and his wife Gloria as they navigate the heady lifestyle of the young and wealthy in 1920s New York. Patch is the presumptive heir to his grandfather's fortune, and keeps his equally spoiled wife in comfort while biding time until his grandfather's death. Patch is unable to hold down any kind of job and spends his days in luxury, indulging in whatever pleasures are available. But as the money begins to fail, so does their marriage. Patch's gradual descent into alcoholism, depression and alienation from his marriage ultimately lead to his ruin. Fitzgerald's novel is a remorseless exploration of the horrors of an age of excess and lost innocence. F. Scott Fitzgerald is regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. Despite his present popularity, Fitzgerald was often in financial trouble, due to the fact that only one of his novels sold well enough to support the extravagant lifestyle that he and his wife Zelda adopted, and later Zelda's medical bills. His novel The Great Gatsby has sold millions of copies and remains a continual best-seller.  Author: F. Scott Fitzgerald ","PKR 295.00","F.

"COLLINS CLASSICS: MRS DALLOWAY (pb)","Clarissa Dalloway is a woman of high-society – vivacious, hospitable and sociable on the surface, yet underneath troubled and dissatisfied with her life in post-war Britain. This disillusionment is an emotion that bubbles under the surface of all of Woolf’s characters in Mrs Dalloway. Centred around one day in June where Clarissa is preparing for and holding a party, her interior monologue mingles with those of the other central characters in a stream of consciousness, entwining, yet never actually overriding the pervading sense of isolation that haunts each person.  One of Virginia Woolf’s most accomplished novels, Mrs Dalloway is widely regarded as one of the most revolutionary works of the 20th century in its style and the themes that it tackles. The sense that Clarissa has married the wrong person, her past love for another female friend and the death of an intended party guest all serve to amplify this stultifying existence.  Author Virginia Woolf was born Adeline Virginia Stephen on 25 January 1882, the daughter of the editor and critic Leslie Stephen. Her early education was provided at home, where she had the free run of her father's extensive library. She suffered a traumatic adolescence after the deaths of her mother, step-sister, father and favourite brother, leaving her prone to mental illness for the rest of her life. During the years leading up to, Virginia Woolf lived in Gordon Square, Bloomsbury, where she was drawn into the company of writers and artists such as Lytton Strachey, J.M. Keynes and Roger Fry. Together they founded the Bloomsbury Group, an intellectual circle which was to profoundly influence the development of the avant-garde in Britain. She married the writer Leonard Woolf in 1912, and they founded the Hogarth Press in 1917, which was to publish the works of T.S. Eliot, the earliest translations of Freud, as well as works by Virginia Woolf herself. Virginia Woolf's first novel, 'The Voyage Out', appeared in 1915, followed by 'Night and Day' (1919) and the highly experimental 'Jacob's Room' (1922). Despite recurring bouts of depression, her literary output over the next twenty years was extraordinary. She wrote her major novels during this period, including 'Mrs Dalloway' (1925), 'To the Lighthouse' (1927), 'Orlando' (1928), 'The Waves' (1931) and 'Between the Acts' (1941). Her writing was particularly concerned with women's experience, not only in her novels but also in her literary criticism and essays, most notably her two masterpieces of feminist polemic, 'A Room of One's Own' (1929) and 'Three Guineas' (1938). In March 1941, her mental condition having deteriorated alarmingly and unable to face another bout of illness, Virginia Woolf took her own life. By the time of her death she had gained a prominent and enduring place in English letters, as a great novelist and essayist, feminist and modernist.","PKR 245.00","VIRGINIA WOOLF",9780007934409,2013,"GENERAL INTEREST > CLASSICS",1,Paperback,English,224,images/books/9780007934409.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780007934409&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

There are contemporary issues in this classic novel's themes such as the moral implications of scientific discovery and how one person's zeal for success can affect others. Although the emotional portrayal of multiple deaths is sometimes melodramatic and the wooden speech of the monster is appropriately pathetic, overall the company moves briskly and skillfully through the story. This recording is best suited for use as a classroom aid in introducing or reviewing the book. Also, it might prove valuable to students preparing a radio theatre adaptation. The thin cardboard jacket is not sturdy enough for frequent circulation and cover art is minimal. Cassettes are clearly marked, and each side is announced. This presentation of Frankenstein is a useful but not essential purchase for school libraries.  by Mary Shelley (Author)    ","PKR 295.00","MARY SHELLEY",9781784871635,2016,"GENERAL INTEREST > CLASSICS",1,Paperback,English,231,images/books/9781784871635.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781784871635&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"VINTAGE CLASSICS: CATCH-22 (pb)","Catch-22 is a satirical, historical novel by the American author Joseph Heller. He began writing it in 1953, and the novel was first published in 1961. It is set during World War II in 1943 and is frequently cited as one of the great literary works of the twentieth century. It uses a distinctive non-chronological third person omniscient narration, describing events from different characters' points of view and out of sequence so that the time line develops along with the plot. The novel follows Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier, and a number of other characters. Most events occur while the Airmen of the fictional 256th squadron are based on the island of Pianosa, in the Mediterranean Sea west of Italy.

"CHAMBER, THE (pb)1995","In 1967 in Greenville, Mississippi, known Klan member Sam Cayhall is accused of bombing the law offices of Jewish civil rights activist Marvin Kramer, killing Kramer's two sons. Cayhall's first trial, with an all-white jury and a Klan rally outside the courthouse, ends in a hung jury; the retrial six months later has the same outcome. Twelve years later an ambitious district attorney in Greenville reopens the case. Much has changed since 1967, and this time, with a jury of eight whites and four blacks, Cayhall is convicted. He is transferred to the state penitentiary at Parchman to await execution on death row. In 1990, in the huge Chicago law firm of Kravitz & Bane, a young lawyer named Adam Hall asks to work on the Cayhall case, which the firm has handled on a pro bono basis for years. But the case is all but lost and time is running out: within weeks Sam Cayhall will finally go to the gas chamber. Why in the world would Adam want to get involved? The author of the number-one bestsellers The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client has written another spellbinding tale of legal intrigue sure to hit bestseller lists this summer. Twenty-two years after the bombing deaths of a civil rights activist's two sons, the Klansman on death row for their murders is mysteriously aided in his last appeal by a young lawyer in a major firm. But why?

"***THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS (pb) 2002***","The Asian literary phenomenon of the 90s. More magical than Mistry, more of a rollicking good read than Rushdie, more nerve-tinglingly imagined than Naipaul, here, perhaps, is the greatest Indian novel by a woman. Arundhati Roy has written an astonishingly rich, fertile novel, teeming with life, colour, heart-stopping language, wry comedy and a hint of magical realism. Set against a background of political turbulence in Kerala, Southern India, The God of Small Things tells the story of twins Esthappen and Rahel. Amongst the vats of banana jam and heaps of peppercorns in their grandmother's factory, they try to craft a childhood for themselves amidst what constitutes their family -- their lonely, lovely mother, their beloved Uncle Chacko (pickle baron, radical Marxist and bottom-pincher) and their avowed enemy Baby Kochamma (ex-nun and incumbent grand-aunt).

"DIGITAL FORTRESS (pb)2004","Digital Fortress is a techno-thriller novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 1998 by St. Martin's Press. The book explores the theme of government surveillance of electronically stored information on the private lives of citizens, and the possible civil liberties and ethical implications using such technology.When the National Security Agency’s invincible code-breaking machine encounters a mysterious code it cannot break, the agency calls in its head cryptographer, Susan Fletcher, a brilliant, beautiful mathematician. What she uncovers sends shock waves through the corridors of power. The NSA is being held hostage not by guns or bombs, but by a code so complex that if released would cripple U.S. intelligence.nnCaught in an accelerating tempest of secrecy and lies, Fletcher battles to save the agency she believes in. Betrayed on all sides, she finds herself fighting not only for her country but for her life, and in the end, for the life of the man she love.  Author: Dan Brown (born June 22, 1964) is an American author of thriller fiction, best known for the 2003 bestselling novel, The Da Vinci Code.

"A ROOM OF ONE'S OWN (pb)2004","In A Room of One's Own, Virginia Woolf imagines that Shakespeare had a sister: a sister equal to Shakespeare in talent, equal in genius, but whose legacy is radically different.This imaginary woman never writes a word and dies by her own hand, her genius unexpressed. But if only she had found the means to create, urges Woolf, she would have reached the same heights as her immortal sibling. In this classic essay, Virginia Woolf takes on the establishment, using her gift of language to dissect the world around her and give a voice to those who have none. Her message is simple: A woman must have a fixed income and a room of her own in order to have the freedom to create.  Annotated and with an introduction by Susan Gubar   About the Author VIRGINIA WOOLF (1882-1941) was?one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century. An admired literary critic, she authored many essays, letters, journals, and short stories in addition to her groundbreaking novels.

"IN THE CITY BY THE SEA (pb)","Hasan is eleven years old. He loves cricket, pomegranates, the night sky, his clever, vibrant artistic mother and his etymologically obsessed lawyer father, and he adores his next-door neighbour Zehra. One early summer morning, while lazing happily on the roof, Hasan watches a young boy flying a yellow kite fall to his death. Soon after, Hasan's idyllic, sheltered family life is shattered when his beloved uncle Salman, a dissenting politician, is arrested and charged with treason. Set in a land ruled by an oppresive military regime, this eloquent, charming and quietly political novel vividly recreates the confusing world of a young boy on the edge of adulthood, and beautifully illustrates the transformative power of the imagination.  About the Author Kamila Shamsie was born in 1973 in Pakistan. Her first novel IN THE CITY BY THE SEA, was published in 1998 and shortlisted for the John Llewelyn Rhys / Mail on Sunday Prize.

"THE EFFECT OF GAMMA RAYS ON MAN-IN-THE-MOON MARIGOLDS (pb)","The Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Paul Zindel, author of the beloved bestselling novel The Pigman, which Publishers Weekly called “remarkable…a story that will not be denied.” Fans of modern classics such as The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton and Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher will find much to love in Paul Zindel's books.  The old, converted vegetable shop where Tillie lives is more like a madhouse than a home. Tillie's mother is bitter and cruel, yet desperate for her daughters' love. Her sister suffers epileptic fits and sneaks cigarettes every chance she gets.  But despite the chaos, Tillie struggles to keep her dreams alive. Tillie—keeper of rabbits, dreamer of atoms, true believer in life, hope, and the effect of gamma rays on man-in-the-moon marigolds...  Paul Zindel’s work is bestselling, critically acclaimed, and passionately embraced by generations of readers.  About the Author Paul Zindel (1936-2003) was born and raised on Staten Island in New York. After teaching high school science for several years, he decided to pursue a career as a playwright. His first play, The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds, won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Shortly thereafter, he wrote his first novel for young adults, The Pigman, which has gone on to sell millions of copies. Mr. Zindel wrote more than fifty books over the course of his life, including the popular My Darling, My Hamburger; The Pigman’s Legacy, a sequel to The Pigman; and the autobiographical The Pigman and Me.","PKR 1,470.00","PAUL ZINDEL",9780060757380,2005,"GENERAL INTEREST > GENERAL FICTION",1,Paperback,English,98,images/books/9780060757380.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780060757380&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

A reluctant partner in this perilous quest is Bilbo Baggins, a comfort-loving unambitious hobbit, who surprises even himself by his resourcefulness and skill as a burglar. Encounters with trolls, goblins, dwarves, elves and giant spiders, conversations with the dragon, Smaug, and a rather unwilling presence at the Battle of Five Armies are just some of the adventures that befall Bilbo. Bilbo Baggins has taken his place among the ranks of the immortals of children's fiction.

"MISTER CLARINET (pb)2006","Pied Piper, Soul Stealer, Serial Killer - Who is Mr. Clarinet? It was a job Miami private investigator Max Mingus found hard to refuse: $10 million to locate billionaire's son Charlie Carver - missing now for over three years. Young Charlie disappeared on the island of Haiti, where over the decades scores of children have vanished. In a country dominated by voodoo, rumours abound of black magic and a mythical figure called 'Mr Clarinet', who for years has been tempting children away from their families. But could the truth be even more shocking than the legend? To find out, Max will have to succeed where previous detectives have not only failed - but where some have died. And suddenly, this job isn't all about finding Charlie or his killers for the money - it's just about staying alive!   About the Author Nick Stone was born in Cambridge in 1966. His father is the historian Norman Stone, and his mother descends from one of Haiti's oldest families, the Aubrys -- some of his later relatives actually worked for Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier, Haiti's most notorious dictator. He is married and lives in London.

"SIX REASONS TO STAY A VIRGIN/ CALLING ON LILY (pb)2007","Emily refuses to sleep with anyone while she's looking for Mr Right. Because of this, Emily is the most irritating person Caitlin knows. More than anything, Caitlin would love to prove to Emily how wrong she is and how she's missing out on the best years of her life. And Caitlin's got a pretty good idea who Emily's Mr Right is too. What could possibly be wrong in getting the two of them together? But is he Emily's Mr Right, or Caitlin's? And does it matter if Caitlin is wrong? As the scheming starts to work and Emily finally begins talking the language of love, it's Caitlin rather than Emily who can think of at least six reasons to stay a virgin . . .

The family has gathered the servants have been given their instructions the invitations sent to Pakistan’s upper crust. But Bilqis is restless—this is not what she had planned for her only son: Kate whom Samad has recently married is Australian and middle class. While Bilqis struggles to reassure herself of her son’s commitment to the family their customs and most of all to herself Pakistan is facing turmoil. Having fortified his dictatorship through a sham referendum General Zia is now set on imposing orthodox Muslim law on the country and news from the border is of an imminent insurgency in Kashmir. Yet against the threats to the liberal space she has always accepted as her privilege Bilqis stands firm—drawing strength from the values of her aristocratic parents and memories of her carefree childhood in undivided India—and refuses with characteristic obstinacy to join Samad in Australia. Then she stumbles upon her servant girl Mumtaz’s secret affair with a Kashmiri freedom fighter—a reckless tryst that threatens to destroy the girl’s honour but for which she claims to have no regrets—and Bilqis is left to examine the convictions that have so long determined her life and her faith in those around her.

"WHITE TIGER: A NOVEL, THE (hb)2008","The White Tiger is a compelling first novel about the new India that is growing roots all around us in unexpected and often ominous ways. Compelling angry and darkly humorous The White Tiger is an unexpected journey into a new India. Aravind Adiga is a talent to watch. Mohsin Hamid Booker-shortlisted author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist. In the grand illusions of a rising India Aravind Adiga has found a subject Gogol might have envied. With remorselessly and delightfully mordant wit The White Tiger anatomises the fantastic cravings of the rich; it evokes too with startling accuracy and tenderness the no less desperate struggles of the deprived. Unlike almost any other Indian novel you might have read in recent years this page-turner offers a completely bald angry unadorned portrait of the country as seen from the bottom of the heap; there s not a sniff of saffron or a swirl of sari anywhere. Narrated by Balram a self-styled entrepreneur who has murdered his employer the book follows his progress from child labourer via humiliation as a servant and driver to a mysterious new life in Bangalore. Balram himself is an enticing figure whose reasons for murder become completely understandable by the end but even more impressive is the nitty-gritty of Indian life that Adiga unearths: the corruption the class system the sheer petty viciousness. The Indian tourist board won t be pleased but you ll read it in a trice and find yourself gripped.   Author: ARAVIND ADIGA a dual Indian-Australian citizen has become only the third debut novelist to win the prestigious Booker Prize for fiction taking the award for The White Tiger. Adiga who moved to Australia when he was 15 and whose father still lives in Sydney received the £50 000 ($A125 000) award at a ceremony in London. At 33 he was the youngest author on the shortlist two years younger than fellow debut novelist and Sydneysider Steve Toltz who also made it to the final six. The chairman of the judges Michael Portillo said: The novel is in many ways perfect. It is quite difficult to find any structural flaws with it. Adiga a former Asia correspondent with Time magazine addressed about 40 journalists after the awards dinner at Guildhall in central London admitting he had not expected to win the Booker. I thought I would be out partying in Soho by now he joked. The White Tiger tells the story of Balram a young Indian born in the darkness of rural India who is seduced by the underbelly of Delhi through his work as a driver to the son of a wealthy landlord. Adiga said he wanted to write a story about the colossal underclass of India and to do so without sentimentality or without depicting them as remorseless humourless weaklings that they are usually .

"RUNNING IN THE FAMILY (pb) 2009","During certain hours, at certain years in our lives, we see ourselves as remnants from the earlier generations that were destroyed...I think all of our lives have been terribly shaped by what went on before us.' Twenty-five years after leaving his native Sri Lanka for the cool winters of Ontario, a chaotic dream of tropical heat and barking dogs pushes Michael Ondaatje to travel back home and revisit a childhood and a family he never fully understood. Along with his siblings and children, Ondaatje gathers rumours, anecdotes, poems, records and memories to piece together this fragmented portrayal of his family's past, his father's destructive alcoholism and the colourful stories and secrets of ancestors both disgraced and adored throughout centuries of Sri Lankan society. In an exotic, evocative portrait of the heat, wildlife, sounds and silences of the Sri Lankan landscape, Ondaatje combines vivid recreations of a privileged, eccentric older generation with a deeply personal reconciliatory journey in which he explores his own ghosts, and how his family's extraordinary history continues to influence his life.

"CONFESSION OF SULTANA DAKU, THE (hb)2009","7 July 1924. Sultana Daku  notorious leader of a gang of bhantu dacoits that terrorized the towns and villages of the United Provinces  awaits Lt. Col. Samuel Pearce’s arrival in Haldwani jail. It is Sultana’s last night. In the morning he will be hanged. Wrapped in a haze of charas and nostalgia  the daku speaks all night as the Englishman listens. He recounts tales of incredible feats and narrow escapes  of the camaraderie he shared with his bhantu companions  of his love for the nautanki dancer Phulkanwar  and of the shocking betrayal that brought him to the gallows. But even as Pearce and the reader are drawn into Sultana’s confession  the contradictions that emerge reveal the daku’s own demons—his fears  superstitions and ruthless excesses—and an unshakeable belief in his criminal destiny that clashes all too often with his secret longings and hopes. Combining swashbuckling adventure with a moving story of human frailty and fortitude  The Confession of Sultana Daku is a grand narrative that is as mesmerizing as it is unsettling. Told with remarkable flair  passion and a rare sensitivity  it seals Sujit Saraf’s reputation as a master storyteller.

But this newfound rapture is to be cut short, and Elijah sees all of his hopes and dreams irrevocably erased as he is swept into a whirlwind of events that threatens his very existence.

"STORIES OF THE SOIL: CLASSIC PUNJABI STORIES (pb)2010","Stories of the Soil is a collection of over forty classic Punjabi short stories. Combining a rich oral tradition of kissas with tropes from Western literature, Punjabi short-story writers have developed their own unique way of portraying love, longing, ecstasy and malice. Spanning a century, these stories talk of life in the village and the town.  There are haunting tales about Partition like A Matter of Faith by Gulzar Singh Sandhu where a horrible tragedy is viewed through the eyes of a child. Along with sensitive accounts of life from across the border in Pakistan are tales by the Dalits who until recently had been rendered voiceless. Amrita Pritam s The Vault , a metaphor for a barren womb, explores the identity of a Punjabi woman while stories like Surjit Birdi s Flies reveals the concerns faced by the Punjabi diaspora.  Translated and edited by Nirupama Dutt, these carefully selected stories reflect every aspect of life in the land of five rivers.  About the Author :  Nirupama Dutt is a poet, art critic and journalist who has published short stories in English and two anthologies of poetry in Punjabi and has received the Punjabi Akademi award for poetry.

"FORGOTTEN (pb)2010","We meet Donna Juliana, a devout Catholic of Portuguese descent, whose influence in the court of the Mughal prince Shah Alam—later Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar I—was so strong, that the Dutch, Portuguese and the British frequently sought her help to get an audience with the ruler.  Similarly, the poetry of the beautiful court poet, singer, song writer and warrior Mahlaqa Bai Chanda was largely ignored by critics for nearly two centuries after her death. At a time when few women could read and write, Mahlaqa received an elaborate education, compiling her first collection of poetry when legendary Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib was just a year old.  The author also draws vivid portraits of Chand Sultana, the Ismaili Muslim warrior-princess who defended Ahmadnagar against the Mughal forces of Emperor Akbar, and of two queens of the Deccan, Rudramma Devi and Hayat Bakshi Begum, who exemplified the ability of women rulers to govern well. The author also remembers Radha Bai, a courageous Brahmin child-widow whose lifelong search to call someone her own touched all those she encountered.  By Bilkees I. Latif","PKR 519.00","BILKEES I.

"HOSHRUBA: THE LAND AND THE TILISM (TILISM-E HOSHRUBA BOOK 1) (pb)2009","In late nineteenth century Lucknow, two rival story-tellers, Syed Muhammad Husain Jah and Ahmed Husain Qamar, wrote a fantasy in the Urdu language whose equal had not been heard before, and which has never been rivalled since. It was called Tilism-e Hoshruba. The writers claimed that the tale had been passed down to them from story-tellers going back centuries: it was a part of the beloved oral epic, The Adventures of Amir Hamza which had come to the Indian subcontinent via Persia and had gained in popularity during the reign of Akbar, the Mughal emperor. The Tilism-e-Hoshruba is the subcontinent’s first wholly indigenous Indo-Islamic fantasy epic. It tells the stories of Amir Hamza’s military forces, his grandson and his loyal band of tricksters (masters of wit and disguise) as they go to war with Afrasiyab, the sorcerer who rules the magical land of Hoshruba. Fantasy, the occult, adventure and romance play themselves out in a typically Indian setting as wizards, sorceresses, tricksters and royalty pitch themselves into the battle for Hoshruba. The characters of the epic are marvels of literary creation, and are much more colourful and dashing than those of the Amir Hamza cycle of tales. The Tilism-e Hoshruba runs to twenty four volumes and will be translated into English for the first time ever by Musharraf Ali Farooqi, the acclaimed translator of The Adventures of Amir Hamza. Random House India will publish all the volumes starting with Hoshruba: The Land and the Tilism, i.e. Book 1 of the series.  Musharraf Ali Farooqi is an author and translator. He has translated The Adventures of Amir Hamza and the poetry of Afzal Ahmed Syed and is currently working on the Urdu Project (www.urduproject. com), an online resource for the study of Urdu language and literature. His novel The Story of a Widow will be published in India in 2009.

Indian soldiers appear as if from nowhere to hunt for militants on the run. Four teenage boys, who used to spend their afternoons playing cricket, or singing Bollywood ballads down by the river, have disappeared one by one, to cross into Pakistan and join the movement against the Indian army. Only one of their friends, the son of the headman, is left behind. The families in the village begin to think it's time to flee, to search for a place of greater safety. But the headman will not allow his family to leave. And, whilst the headman watches his dreams give way beneath the growing violence, his son, under the brutal, drunken gaze of the Indian army captain, is seemingly forced to collaborate and go into the valley to count the corpses, fearing, each day, that he will discover one of his friends lying amongst the dead.

"JANE AUSTEN EDUCATION: SIX NOVELS TAUGHT ME ABOUT LOVE, FRIENDSHIP AND THE THINGS THAT REALLY, A MATTER (hb)2011","In A Jane Austen Education, Austen scholar William Deresiewicz turns to the author's novels to reveal the remarkable life lessons hidden within. With humor and candor, Deresiewicz employs his own experiences to demonstrate the enduring power of Austen's teachings. Progressing from his days as an immature student to a happily married man, Deresiewicz's A Jane Austen Education is the story of one man's discovery of the world outside himself.   A self-styled intellectual rebel dedicated to writers such as James Joyce and Joseph Conrad, Deresiewicz never thought Austen's novels would have anything to offer him. But when he was assigned to read Emma as a graduate student at Columbia, something extraordinary happened. Austen's devotion to the everyday, and her belief in the value of ordinary lives, ignited something in Deresiewicz. He began viewing the world through Austen's eyes and treating those around him as generously as Austen treated her characters. Along the way, Deresiewicz was amazed to discover that the people in his life developed the depth and richness of literary characters-that his own life had suddenly acquired all the fascination of a novel. His real education had finally begun.   Weaving his own story-and Austen's-around the ones her novels tell, Deresiewicz shows how her books are both about education and themselves an education. Her heroines learn about friendship and feeling, staying young and being good, and, of course, love. As they grow up, they learn lessons that are imparted to Austen's reader, who learns and grows by their sides.   A Jane Austen Education is a testament to the transformative power of literature, a celebration of Austen's mastery, and a joy to read. Whether for a newcomer to Austen or a lifelong devotee, Deresiewicz brings fresh insights to the novelist and her beloved works. Ultimately, Austen's world becomes indelibly entwined with our own, showing the relevance of her message and the triumph of her vision.  About the Author William Deresiewicz was an associate professor of English at Yale University until 2008 and is a widely published book critic. His reviews and essays have appeared in The New York Times, The New Republic, The Nation, Bookforum, and The American Scholar. He was nominated for National Magazine awards in 2008 and 2009 and the National Book Critics Circle's Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing in 2010.

"CHARLES DICKENS: A LIFE (hb)2011","Charles Dickens was a phenomenon: a demonically hardworking journalist, the father of ten children, a tireless walker and traveller, a supporter of liberal social causes, but most of all a great novelist - the creator of characters who live immortally in the English imagination: the Artful Dodger, Mr Pickwick, Pip, David Copperfield, Little Nell, Lady Dedlock, and many more. At the age of twelve he was sent to work in a blacking factory by his affectionate but feckless parents. From these unpromising beginnings, he rose to scale all the social and literary heights, entirely through his own efforts. When he died, the world mourned, and he was buried - against his wishes - in Westminster Abbey. Yet the brilliance concealed a divided character: a republican, he disliked America; sentimental about the family in his writings, he took up passionately with a young actress; usually generous, he cut off his impecunious children. Claire Tomalin, author of Whitbread Book of the Year Samuel Pepys, paints an unforgettable portrait of Dickens, capturing brilliantly the complex character of this great genius.

And Cayla's not just anyone--she's the daughter of Hazel Bannock, heiress to the Bannock Oil Corporation, one of the world's foremost oil producers.  The sensitive global political climate means not even the most powerful groups in the world can intervene. Left to handle the problem on her own, Hazel calls on Hector Cross, head of the security agency that protects Bannock Oil. As threats increase and evidence arises of horrific torture, the need to take action becomes more urgent than ever--and soon Hazel and Hector will have no choice but to take the law into their own hands…    BY:Wilbur Smith  ","PKR 1,151.00","WILBUR SMITH",9780230753334,2011,"GENERAL INTEREST > GENERAL FICTION",1,Paperback,English,385,images/books/9780230753334.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780230753334&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"RELEASE AND OTHER STORIES (NEW) (hb)2011","In this collection of stories, Rakhshanda Jalil draws attention to the lives of the Indian Muslim, not the marginalized or ghettoized Muslims of popular stereotype but ordinary, mainstream ones. The minutiae of everyday life are captured as layers of identities are peeled back to reveal people who are strangely recognizable in their ordinariness. Perfectly engraved cameos of grief and separation, frailty and strength, resilience and defeat, revenge and jealousy glow in the tautly strung warp and weft of her stories. While the title story is an exquisite invocation of a vanished world, the others deal with contemporary, commonplace issues. The illusion of domestic harmony, the discord that breeds within a marriage, the definitions of success or failure; the inexplicability of what attracts one person to another ? the author explores all this and more as she lays bare a world at once familiar and little known.

"GODS WITHOUT MEN (pb)2011","2008. The California desert. A four-year-old boy disappears in the wilderness and his parents find themselves at the centre of a media witch-hunt. A British rock star hides out at a run-down motel. A teenage Iraqi refugee lives a surreal life as a role-player in a military simulation.  The present is connected to the past. The earth is connected to the sky. These stories connect with others - an eighteenth-century Franciscan explorer; a Mormon miner who can hear the silver singing in the rocks; a guilt-ridden aircraft engineer trying to contact Venus. Behind them all is Coyote, the trickster, who subverts the laws of Gods and men.  A compulsively readable journey into the twists and turns of a handful of human lives, Gods Without Men is also a heartfelt exploration of our search for pattern and meaning in a random and chaotic universe.  Hari Kunzru was born in 1969 and lives in east London. His first novel, The Impressionist, was the winner of the Betty Trask Prize 2002 and shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award and the Whitbread First Novel Award.

"JAMES BOND: ICEBREAKER (pb)","Bond reluctantly finds himself recruited into a dangerous mission involving an equally dangerous and treacherous alliance of agents from the CIA, the KGB and Israel's Mossad.   The team dubbed 'Icebreaker' waste no time double crossing each other, as they try to root out the leader of the murderous National Socialist Action Army, Count Konrad von Gloda, a one time SS officer, who now perceives himself as the New Adolf Hitler.   About the Author  After Colonel Sun (1968) by Kingsley Amis, John Gardner was the next writer to be asked to write further adventures of James Bond. He wrote, like Fleming, fourteen Bond books, plus novelisations of the films GoldenEye and Licence to Kill, from 1981 to 1996.   Before becoming an author of fiction in the early 1960s John Gardner was variously a stage magician, a Royal Marine officer, a journalist and, for a short time, a priest in the Church of England. 'Probably the biggest mistake I ever made,' he says. 'I confused the desire to please my father with a vocation which I soon found I did not have.'   In all, Gardner had fifty-five novels to his credit - many of them bestsellers.

"AN AMERICAN BRAT","Feroza Ginwalla, a pampered, protected 16-year-old Pakistani girl, is sent to America by her parents, who are alarmed by the fundamentalism overtaking Pakistan — and their daughter. Hoping that a few months with her uncle, an MIT grad student, will soften the girl’s rigid thinking, they get more than they bargained for: Feroza, enthralled by American culture and her new freedom, insists on staying. A bargain is struck, allowing Feroza to attend college with the understanding that she will return home and marry well. As a student in a small western town, Feroza’s perceptions of America, her homeland, and herself begin to alter. When she falls in love with and wants to marry a Jewish American, her family is aghast. Feroza realizes just how far she has come — and wonders how much further she can go. This delightful coming-of-age novel is both remarkably funny and a remarkably acute portrayal of America as seen through the eyes of a perceptive young  immigrant.

"NCS: MACBETH (pb)2012","This is the most extensively annotated edition of Macbeth currently available, offering a thorough reconsideration of one of Shakespeare's most popular plays. A full and accessible  updated introduction studies the immediate theatrical and political contexts of Macbeth's composition, especially the Gunpowder Plot and the contemporary account of an early  performance at the Globe. It treats such issues as whether the Witches compel Macbeth to murder; whether Lady Macbeth is herself in some sense a witch; whether Banquo is Macbeth's accomplice in crime; and what criticism is levelled against Macduff. Several possible new sources are suggested, and the presence of Thomas Middleton's writing in the play is proposed. An extensive, well-illustrated account of the play in performance examines several cinematic versions, such as those by Kurosawa and Roman Polanski, and a brand new introductory section on recent performances and adaptations brings the edition completely up-to-date.

Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved classic is adapted for beginning readers in this colorfully illustrated version. The spoiled orphan Mary Lennox leaves India to live with her cold uncle in his dreary mansion in England. When Mary hears of a secret garden kept locked for ten years, she is determined to find it and tend it back to life.

"SCARLET LETTER, THE (pb) 2012","When it first appeared in 1850, The Scarlet Letter enjoyed scandalous success. New England critics condemned its passionate subject matter. One critic complained that Nathaniel Hawthorne invested adultery with all the fascination of genius, and all the charms of a highly polished style. My preliminary chapter, wryly noted the author, has caused the greatest uproar that has happened here since witch-times.   As she emerges from the prison of a Puritan New England town, Hester Prynne defies the dark gloom much as the rose blooms against the prison door. With her illegitimate baby, Pearl, clutched in her arms and the letter A—the mark of an adulteress—embroidered in scarlet thread on her breast, Hester holds her head high as she faces the malice and scorn of the townsfolk.

"THE UNBECOMING OF MARA DYER (pb)","Mara Dyer doesn’t know if she is crazy or haunted—all she knows is that everyone around her is dying in this suspenseful and “strong, inventive tale” (Kirkus Reviews).  Mara Dyer doesn’t think life can get any stranger than waking up in a hospital with no memory of how she got there.      It can.      She believes there must be more to the accident she can’t remember that killed her friends and left her mysteriously unharmed.      There is.      She doesn’t believe that after everything she’s been through, she can fall in love.      She’s wrong.      After Mara survives the traumatizing accident at the old asylum, it makes sense that she has issues. She lost her best friend, her boyfriend, and her boyfriend’s sister, and as if that weren’t enough to cope with, her family moves to a new state in order to give her a fresh start. But that fresh start is quickly filled with hallucinations—or are they premonitions?—and then corpses, and the boundary between reality and nightmare is wavering. At school, there’s Noah, a devastatingly handsome charmer who seems determined to help Mara piece together what’s real, what’s imagined—and what’s very, very dangerous.      This fast-paced psychological—or is it paranormal?—thriller will leave you breathless for its sequel, The Evolution of Mara Dyer.","PKR 795.00","MICHELLE HODKIN",9781442421776,2012,"GENERAL INTEREST > GENERAL FICTION",1,Paperback,English,456,images/books/9781442421776.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781442421776&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"BEFORE THE THRONE: A NOVEL (pb)2012","Nearly sixty of Egypt’s past leaders—from the time of the Pharoahs to the twentieth century—are summoned to judgment in the Court of Osiris in the Afterlife, in this extraordinary novel by Nobel Prize–winning author Naguib Mahfouz.  Before the Throne calls forth a parade of those who have shaped the modern nation of Egypt—from the ruler who first unified Egypt in 3000 BC to Anwar Sadat, the president assassinated by religious extremists in 1981, and including figures as various as the famous pharaoh Ramesses II and the medieval vizier Qaraqush. As they defend their decisions under questioning by Osiris, Isis, and Horus, those who acted for the nation’s good are honored with immortality in paradise while those who failed to protect it are condemned either to the inferno or to “the place of insignificance.” Full of Mahfouz’s unique insight into his country’s timeless qualities, this provocative work skillfully traces five thousand years of Egypt’s past as it flows into the turbulent present.  Translated from the Arabic by Raymond Stock   About the Author Naguib Mahfouz was born in 1911 in Cairo and began writing at the age of seventeen. His first novel was published in 1939 and he went on to write nearly forty novel-length works and hundreds of short stories. In 1988 Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died in 2006.

"THE PRISONER (pb)","On an unusually cold December evening in Karachi, American journalist Jon Friedland is kidnapped from one of the city’s poshest neighbourhoods. His captors plan to post a video of his execution on Christmas Day. The kidnapping has come at a bad time, embarrassing the Pakistani government in front of their US allies. The clock is ticking. Will the police and Intelligence Agencies recover Friedland alive?   With the stakes so high, only one man can possibly crack the case: Akbar Khan, a police officer who has been languishing in Karachi’s Central Prison for years, punished and betrayed for a crime he did not commit. In desperation, the Agencies ask Constantine D’Souza, a Christian police officer who serves as Superintendent of the Prison, to get Khan to cooperate. But there are others who are not as eager to allow Khan back out from his prison cell, most of all the United Front, the fascist political party that controls the city with an iron fist.   Caught in the middle is D’Souza – pressured by the Agencies to help them tap Khan for information, and by the United Front to ensure that the scheme does not succeed. 25 December approaches and the fate of Friedland hangs in the balance.   The story careens through the streets of Karachi for a ground-level tour of the War on Terror, taking the reader into an all too real world of jihadis, corrupt police officers, duplicitous members of the Intelligence Agencies, and bloodthirsty political henchmen – all placed together in a city where no one is quite what they seem.

"MIRROR OF BEAUTY, THE (hb)2013","It is the sunset of the Mughal Empire. The splendour of imperial Delhi flares one last time. The young daughter of a craftsman in the city elopes with an officer of the East India Company. And so we are drawn into the story of Wazir Khanam: a dazzlingly beautiful and fiercely independent woman who takes a series of lovers, including a Navab and a Mughal prince—and whom history remembers as the mother of the famous poet Dagh. But it is not just one life that this novel sets out to capture: it paints in rapturous detail an entire civilization. Beginning with the story of an enigmatic and gifted painter in a village near Kishangarh, The Mirror of Beauty embarks on an epic journey that sweeps through the death-giving deserts of Rajputana, the verdant valley of Kashmir and the glorious cosmopolis of Delhi, the craft of miniature painting and the art of carpet designing, scintillating musical performances and recurring paintings of mysterious, alluring women. Its scope breathtaking, its language beguiling, and its style sumptuous, this is a work of profound beauty, depth and power.

"AY GHAZAAL-I-SHAB (hb)","A COUPLE of years ago, Mustansar Hussain Tarar graciously allowed his readers a peep into the magic world of literary creativity when he converted a 10-second interaction with a World War II veteran into a full-scale short story. His latest offering, in ways more than one, is but an extension of that master class. If he was good in his earlier effort, this time round he is absolutely amazing.Those who have read Tarar’s travelogue about his visit to Russia, Moscow Ki Safaid Raatain, would easily recall the character of Boris that he created when a student of Moscow University, where he had been invited to deliver a lecture, asked him about the process of creativity and the element of characterisation. A chance encounter with the veteran the preceding day was enough for him to weave together a story that was not just coherent, but captivating.  Aay Ghazaal-i-Shab is a novel that has been carved out for the most part from his time in Moscow. Some of the real-life characters in the travelogue now stand to gain immortality in fiction — Zaheeruddin, Waris Chaudhry, Qadir Qureishi and Sardar Qalib, to name a few.  They represent the large number of people who had at one point in time believed in the socialist ideology and had moved to the erstwhile Soviet Union to help it help the workers of the world unite for they had nothing to lose but chains.  There they settled down, married, had kids and life went on smoothly till things changed and the workers of the world began to realise that for every chain they were losing, they had to carry two more. From glasnost and perestroika to ultimate collapse, the journey, if anything, was quick, and gave little time for the person on the street to adjust.  It was even trickier for the non-Soviets as they fell from the status of heroes who had left their homeland for a cause, to nothing more than outsiders, and had to face a certain degree of xenophobia. There were some who changed with the changing times and made it big, like Chaudhry and Qureishi. Some — like Qalib, for instance — had Russian in-laws with meaningful connections. But there were also others like Zaheer who suffered disillusionment — both in ideological and existential terms. It is this disillusionment that Tarar has touched upon at length and with dexterity and finesse in the novel.  In doing so, Tarar has been able to capture the irony of the transformed scenario at both the social and individual levels. His description of Lenin’s statues being converted into molten metal to produce the Christian Cross, and of the life and plight of a revolutionary poet, bear ample proof in this regard. Though the poet has been named Sardar Seemab, the description — and especially the “Mein Nahin Manta” refrain — leaves no doubt about the real-life identity of the character. It is an irony in itself that while Tarar’s words may offend some of the large number of Seemab’s fans, they nevertheless capture the miserable contrast between the words and the deeds of a lot of ‘Seemabs’ amid us.  Broadening the scope of his main focus, Tarar has also brought in Arif Naqvi from Berlin and Mustafa Islam Shaikh from Budapest. This has given him more ground to build his argument and to make it more persuasive and convincing. A widely travelled man, Tarar has the capacity to deal with a varying atmosphere but he can be seen in his true element when, driven out by disillusionment and lured in by nostalgia, four of the main characters — Zaheer, Qalib, Naqvi and Shaikh — travel to Lahore in search of their roots, only to feel a lot more disillusioned.  In some of his earlier novels, Tarar, the writer, was a bit louder than the characters he was dealing with. Aay Ghazaal-i-Shab is absolutely flawless on this count. In the backdrop of a multicultural milieu, the characters bring in their own thoughts and arguments and express them in their own idioms. Tarar becomes a mere bystander listening to their conversations and noting them down. One really can’t get better than that in terms of striking a balance between characterisation and narrative.  It is difficult to say for sure which side of the argument Tarar himself happens to take, for instance, when Zaheer starts feeling sympathetic towards the Taliban and when Naqvi draws parallels between the leftists of yore and the rightists of today. In other places, some characters keep promoting the Sufi thought pattern of Oneness in multiplicity and multiplicity in Oneness. It is as if the characters have simply decided to ignore the writer.  For such a piece of fiction that deals with subjects and issues of modern day existence, the climax could not have been more apt. Naqvi, who had once worked in theatre in pre-Partition India, appears for an audition in a play being staged in Lahore. With all the momentum of the story behind him, he brings the curtain down with a monologue that is nothing short of a thumping crescendo. Tarar, the writer, remains silent even though he should have been offering a standing ovation to Naqvi, his creation, for what surely was the performance of his life.

This second novel in the Teardrop series is intensely romantic, with strong, hot main characters caught up in a thrilling fantastical love triangle. For readers who love Lauren Kate and the worlds of Alyson Noël, P. C. Cast, Maggie Stiefvater, and Veronica Rossi.   Eureka’s tears have flooded the earth, and now Atlantis is rising, bringing with it its evil king, Atlas. Eureka is the only one who can stop him, but first she must learn how to fight. She travels across the ocean with Cat, her family, and Ander, the gorgeous and mysterious Seedbearer who promises to help her find Solon, an enigmatic lost Seedbearer who knows how to defeat Atlas. Once on land, Eureka is taunted by gossipwitches, a group of displaced Atlantean sorceresses, and ambushed by locals struggling to survive amid the destruction her tears have wrought. And she feels no closer to facing Atlas or saving the world when Solon lets slip that love is Ander’s weakness, and that any affection he feels toward her makes him age faster. Trying to make sense of the dark world her sorrow has created, Eureka receives startling insight from an enchanted pond. Her bewildering reflection reveals a soul-crushing secret: if she’s strong enough, Eureka can draw on this knowledge to defeat Atlas—unless her broken heart is just what he needs to fuel his rising kingdom. . . .

The young daughter of a craftsman in the city elopes with an officer of the East India Company.

As a private detective in Calcutta she had impressed maverick security expert Shayak Gupta with her sleuthing skills, leading to a new job with his firm Titanium. Now in Mumbai she is given the case of the year – the murder of Ashutosh Dhingre, former assistant to fading Bollywood superstar Kimaaya Kapoor.   The location of the crime is Kimaaya’s private island. The suspects – her house guests, and Kimaaya herself!  Reema learns of Kimaaya’s prior relationship with Shayak, and can’t help but think it is a conflict of interest. Equally puzzling is Shayak’s repeated absence. And what of the continuing attraction simmering between her and her secretive boss?

"HOW TO GET FILTHY RICH IN RISING ASIA (pb) 2014","“Mr. Hamid reaffirms his place as one of his generation’s most inventive and gifted writers.” –Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times  “A globalized version of The Great Gatsby . . . [Hamid's] book is nearly that good.” –Alan Cheuse, NPR  “Marvelous and moving.” –TIME Magazine  From the internationally bestselling author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist, the boldly imagined tale of a poor boy’s quest for wealth and love . . .  His first two novels established Mohsin Hamid as a radically inventive storyteller with his finger on the world’s pulse. How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia meets that reputation—and exceeds it. The astonishing and riveting tale of a man’s journey from impoverished rural boy to corporate tycoon, it steals its shape from the business self-help books devoured by ambitious youths all over “rising Asia.” It follows its nameless hero to the sprawling metropolis where he begins to amass an empire built on that most fluid, and increasingly scarce, of goods: water. Yet his heart remains set on something else, on the pretty girl whose star rises along with his, their paths crossing and recrossing, a lifelong affair sparked and snuffed and sparked again by the forces that careen their fates along.  How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia is a striking slice of contemporary life at a time of crushing upheaval. Romantic without being sentimental, political without being didactic, and spiritual without being religious, it brings an unflinching gaze to the violence and hope it depicts. And it creates two unforgettable characters who find moments of transcendent intimacy in the midst of shattering change.

Most of the infected perished, while many of the children who survived were left with strange markings. Adelina’s black hair turned silver, her lashes went pale, and now she has only a jagged scar where her left eye once was. Her cruel father believes she is a malfetto, an abomination, ruining their family’s good name and standing in the way of their fortune. But some of the fever’s survivors are rumored to possess more than just scars—they are believed to have mysterious and powerful gifts, and though their identities remain secret, they have come to be called the Young Elites. Teren Santoro works for the king. As Leader of the Inquisition Axis, it is his job to seek out the Young Elites, to destroy them before they destroy the nation. He believes the Young Elites to be dangerous and vengeful, but it’s Teren who may possess the darkest secret of all. Enzo Valenciano is a member of the Dagger Society. This secret sect of Young Elites seeks out others like them before the Inquisition Axis can. But when the Daggers find Adelina, they discover someone with powers like they’ve never seen.

"DISCONTENT AND ITS CIVILIZATIONS: DISPATCHES FROM LAHORE, NEW YORK, AND LONDON (hb) 2015","From “one of his generation’s most inventive and gifted writers” (The New York Times), intimate and sharply observed commentary on life, art, politics, and “the war on terror.” Mohsin Hamid’s brilliant, moving, and extraordinarily clever novels have not only made him an international bestseller, they have earned him a reputation as a “master critic of the modern global condition” (Foreign Policy). His stories are at once timeless and of-the-moment, and his themes are universal: love, language, ambition, power, corruption, religion, family, identity. Here he explores this terrain from a different angle in essays that deftly counterpoise the personal and the political, and are shot through with the same passion, imagination, and breathtaking shifts of perspective that gives his fiction its unmistakable electric charge. A “water lily” who has called three countries on three continents his home—Pakistan, the birthplace to which he returned as a young father; the United States, where he spent his childhood and young adulthood; and Britain, where he married and became a citizen—Hamid writes about overlapping worlds with fluidity and penetrating insight. Whether he is discussing courtship rituals or pop culture, drones or the rhythms of daily life in an extended family compound, he transports us beyond the scarifying headlines of an anxious West and a volatile East, beyond stereotype and assumption, and helps to bring a dazzling diverse global culture within emotional and intellectual reach.

"ROBINSON CRUSOE (pb)","The sole survivor of a shipwreck, Robinson Crusoe is washed up on a desert island. In his journal he chronicles his daily battle to stay alive, as he conquers isolation, fashions shelter and clothes, first encounters another human being and fights off cannibals and mutineers. With Robinson Crusoe, Defoe wrote what is regarded as the first English novel, and created one of the most popular and enduring myths in literature. Written in an age of exploration and enterprise, it has been variously interpreted as an embodiment of British imperialist values, as a portrayal of 'natural man' or as a moral fable. But above all it is a brilliant narrative, depicting Crusoe's transformation from terrified survivor to self-sufficient master of his island.This edition contains a full chronology of Defoe's life and times, explanatory notes, glossary and a critical introduction discussing Robinson Crusoe as a pioneering work of modern psychological realism.  About The Author :  Daniel Defoe was born in 1660 in London, England. He became a merchant and participated in several failing businesses, facing bankruptcy and aggressive creditors. He was also a prolific political pamphleteer which landed him in prison for slander. Late in life he turned his pen to fiction and wrote Robinson Crusoe, one of the most widely read and influential novels of all time.

"THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD (hb) 2016","About The Underground Railroad (Oprah’s Book Club) From #1 New York Times bestseller and National Book Award finalist Colson Whitehead, a magnificent tour de force chronicling a young slave’s adventures as she makes a desperate bid for freedom in the antebellum South  Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. Life is hell for all the slaves, but especially bad for Cora; an outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is coming into womanhood—where even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.      In Whitehead’s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.      Like the protagonist of Gulliver’s Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is at once a kinetic adventure tale of one woman’s ferocious will to escape the horrors of bondage and a shattering, powerful meditation on the history we all share.  Author: Colson Whitehead COLSON WHITEHEAD is the New York Times bestselling author of The Noble Hustle,Zone One, Sag Harbor, The Intuitionist, John Henry Days, Apex Hides the Hurt, and one collection of essays, The Colossus of New York.

"WHITER THAN WHITE: THE DAUGHTER OF THE LAND OF PURE (pb) 2017","Written by seasoned police officer and accomplished writer, J. J. BAloch, Whiter Than White is the story of Hoor, an ordinary woman caught up in the throes of extraordinary circumstances. Hoor fosters her faith and cultivates confidence in her own destiny, protecting her womanhood with the tenacity of a wounded mother lion against the system that engulfs her world. Whiter Than White details Hoor’s journey from growing up in a hostile system in Pakistan and rising to the precipice of greatness and fame as the story unfolds. Whiter Than White is unique in its approach to the telling of Hoor’s story. While detailing her personal journey, J J. BAloch comprehensively addresses the different issues of women in sub-continental set-ups, specifically Pakistan. Drawing on the mistreatment of women and women’s rights, this novel sheds light on a society that considers women a symbol of misfortune, where they are arrested, prosecuted, imprisoned and sentenced without being involved in any violation of the law, and where they are presented as sexual tools for the pleasure of men, discriminated against on the basis of their gender. This novel touches on the sensitive systems of society and state, which are designed to perpetuate the status quo of male dominance, orthodoxy, discriminations, biases, intolerance, extremism and hatred against women. J. J. BAloch’s experience working in the police, specifically relating to crimes against women, adds a layer of authenticity to his writing that will be enjoyed by those who enjoy feminist literature and who are looking to deepen their understanding of women’s rights in other societies.  Author.Javed Jiskani Baloch J. J. BAloch is a senior police officer in Pakistan with 16 years experience having served as a district police officer in eleven districts of Pakistan. In addition, he has used his unique signature and voice to produce three books, Introduction to Sociology, On the Art of Writing Essays and The Power of Social Media & Policing Challenges.

On the journey from revolutionary Mexico in 1918 to the saloons of San Antonio during the Hole in the Wall Gang’s reign, we meet three extraordinary women: the Danish immigrant who is Ishmael’s mother and Hackberry’s one true love; a brothel madam descended from the Crusader knight who brought the Shroud of Turin back from the Holy Land; and a onetime lover of the Sundance Kid, whose wiles rival those of Lady Macbeth. In her own way, each woman will aid Hack in his quest to reconcile with Ishmael, to vanquish their enemies, and to return the Grail to its rightful place.

"THREE DAUGHTERS OF EVE (pb)","A powerful, sweeping tale of faith, love and friendship set across Istanbul and Oxford.  Set across Istanbul and Oxford, from the 1980s to the present day, Three Daughters of Eve is a sweeping tale of faith and friendship, tradition and modernity, love and an unexpected betrayal.  Peri, a wealthy Turkish housewife and mother, is on her way to a dinner party at a seaside mansion in Istanbul when a beggar snatches her handbag. As she wrestles to get it back, a photograph falls to the ground - an old polaroid of three young women and their university professor. A relic from a past - and a love Peri had tried desperately to forget.  The photograph takes Peri back to Oxford University, as nineteen year old sent abroad for the first time. To her dazzling, rebellious Professor and his life-changing course on God. To the house she shares with her two best friends, Shirin and Mona, and their arguments about identity, Islam and feminism. And finally, to the scandal that tore them all apart.  Shirin, Peri and Mona, they were the most unlikely of friends. They were the Sinner, the Believer and the Confused.

"THE SLEEPING SWORD (pb)","An enchanting take on the legend of King Arthur from War Horse author and former Children's Laureate Michael Morpurgo. ‘There stood before me an ancient man swathed in a dark and tattered fleece, his long hair and beard matted with filth, his face grey with grief and age. Holding the sword out in front of me, I backed away until I felt the sink behind me and I could go no further. His eyes followed me all the way.' When Bun Bendle is struck blind, he feels like he is drowning in blackness. But the discovery of an ancient tomb and a strangely familiar sword changes him forever. The Sleeping Sword weaves a contemporary tale with Arthurian legend in a way that is utterly spellbinding. A gripping children's adventure from the master storyteller of An Eagle in the Snow, Listen to the Moon, Shadow, Arthur, High King of Britain and An Elephant in the Garden.  Former Children's Laureate Michael Morpurgo needs no introduction. He is one of the most successful children's authors in the country, loved by children, teachers and parents alike. Michael has written more than forty books for children including the global hit War Horse, which was made into a Hollywood film by Steven Spielberg in 2011. Several of his other stories have been adapted for screen and stage, including My Friend Walter, Why the Whales Came and Kensuke's Kingdom. Michael has won the Whitbread Award, the Smarties Award, the Circle of Gold Award, the Children's Book Award and has been short-listed for the Carnegie Medal four times. He started the charity Farms for City Children in 1976 with his wife, Clare, aimed at relieving the “poverty of experience” many young children feel in inner city and urban areas. Michael is also a patron of over a dozen other charities. Living in Devon, listening to Mozart and working with children have provided Michael with the ideas and incentive to write his stories. He spends half his life mucking out sheds with the children, feeding sheep or milking cows; the other half he spends dreaming up and writing stories for children.","PKR 795.00","MICHAEL MORPURGO",9781405239622,2017,"GENERAL INTEREST > GENERAL FICTION",1,Paperback,English,227,images/books/9781405239622.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781405239622&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

He’s travelling to a business conference for a story, and doesn’t seem impressed by her involvement. But as soon as they’re out of the office, things change, and it becomes clear that there is more to Rajesh’s trip than meets the eye. As Prisha is drawn into the story he’s trying to hide from their editor, their hunt for the story grows more intense, and she finds herself growing closer to Rajesh. As their chemistry threatens to overwhelm them and Prisha is pulled deeper into the Seductive Affair, she must decide what matters most to her – matters of the head, or of the heart.

"ELEFANT (pb) 2018","The international bestseller about friendship, second chances, and a tiny glow-in-the-dark pink elephant The most enjoyable novel I’ve read all year’ Elizabeth McKenzie, author of The Portable Veblen  'I loved Elefant! It was a complete tonic' Seni Glaister, author of The Museum of Things Left Behind  It's easy to fall in love with this novel because it's easy to fall in love with its main character, a tiny, glowing, pink elephant.’ Homer Hickam, author of Carry Albert Home  What would you do if you woke up to see a living, breathing, tiny, glowing, pink elephant? If you’re anything like Schoch, who lives on the streets of Zrich and is decidedly down on his luck, you might well think it’s time to put away the bottle before your hallucinations get any stranger, and go back to sleep.  But what if the tiny pink elephant is still there when you wake up? And clearly needs someone to take care of it? And what if you discover that it’s been created through genetic engineering, by a group of scientists who just want to use it to get rich and don’t care about the elephant’s welfare? And that they’re in cahoots with a circus and will stop at nothing to get it back?

"MILKMAN (pb)","'Milkman is extraordinary. I've been reading passages aloud for the pleasure of hearing it. It's frightening, hilarious, wily and joyous all at the same time.' - Lisa McInerney, author of The Glorious Heresies  In this unnamed city, to be interesting is dangerous. Middle sister, our protagonist, is busy attempting to keep her mother from discovering her maybe-boyfriend and to keep everyone in the dark about her encounter with Milkman. But when first brother-in-law sniffs out her struggle, and rumours start to swell, middle sister becomes 'interesting'. The last thing she ever wanted to be. To be interesting is to be noticed and to be noticed is dangerous.  Milkman is a tale of gossip and hearsay, silence and deliberate deafness. It is the story of inaction with enormous consequences.  Author: 	 Anna Burns Anna Burns was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. She is the author of two novels, No Bones and Little Constructions, and of the novella, Mostly Hero.

"MODERN PAINTER WRITERS ON ARTISTS (hb)2002","From the pages of the British art magazine Modern Painter comes Writers on Artists, an immensely readable collection of works written on a wide selection of artists. Included visual artists range from legends like Matisse and Brancusi to contemporary firebrands like Damien Hirst and filmmaker Harmony Korine. The writers are other artists, art critics, fiction writers, and poets, all deeply moved by and invested in the artwork they've written about. Author Nick Hornby of High Fidelity fame finds inspiration in Richard Bellingham's tragic but unsentimental photographic portraits of his alcoholic father and overweight mother. In dramatic contrast, op artist Bridget Riley traces the artistic development of Piet Mondrian while praising his vivid use of color. Not surprisingly, each writer approaches art and writing very differently. British poet laureate Andrew Motion writes a poem about the work of hyperrealist American sculptor Duane Hanson, while art lover and musician David Bowie records an interview and spends a day with bad-girl British sensation Tracey Emin. Each section includes brief bios on both artist and writer. With topnotch artwork and great writers, this book is a joy for any art aficionado. --J.P.

"RENAISSANCE ART IN FRANCE, THE INVENTION OF CLASSICISM (pb) 2004","Harvard professor Zerner focuses on one of the most dynamic and flamboyant periods in art history, the Renaissance in France. Renaissance Art in France explains how the school of Fontainebleau, in its exaggerated elegance and complex fantasies, combined French forms of medieval origin with the Italianate decorative style. It quickly came to represent a high point in the development of Mannerism and laid the groundwork for the invention of French Classicism. The volume showcases artists who excelled in the fine arts such as court portraitist François Clouet and sculptor Jean Goujon, as well as those working in decorative arts that also flourished during this period: tapestry, stained-glass windows, printmaking, and metalwork. With beautiful illustrations and an accessible text, it is all summed up here in one compact volume.  Author: Henri Zerner, originally from France, is a professor of art history at Harvard University and former curator of the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

"STEREOGRAPHICS: GRAPHICS IN NEW DIMENSIONS (pb)2008","This ground breaking new book explores how the pathways of graphic design are moving away from the over exposed digital medium and turning to the crafty real-world manifestations of analog inspired visual ideas. One brilliant method within this milieu is the creation of graphics in a sculptural or 3 dimensional environment. Logos are no longer flat, but are designed to reflect a physical presence that is palpably discernible on the printed page; typefaces are carved and sculpted. All of which means, that the edges between the real, the physical and the imagined have again been blurred. Stereographics explores how the discipline of prop building and model creation can be applied in graphic design, especially in innovative and fresh new font design. It features hundreds of successful projects including promotional flyers, brochures, in-store graphics, textiles and clothing.","PKR 1,395.00",". . .",9789889822903,2008,"GENERAL INTEREST > ART / FASHION / PAINTING",1,Paperback,English,256,images/books/9789889822903.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9789889822903&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"GLIMMER: HOW DESIGN CAN TRANSFORM YOUR BUSINESS YOUR LIFE & MAYBE EVEN THE WORLD (pb)2009","For a new generation of designers  such as Bruce Mau and Yves Behar  the answer is  ‘Yes  it can.’ To them  design is more than just a question of fashion or taste; it s a way of asking fundamental questions in order to solve complex problems. In Glimmer  award-winning journalist Warren Berger shows how these visionary thinkers are taking design principles out of the studio and applying them to the tough issues of today  from making medicines safer to counteracting the threats of global warming. By approaching seemingly intractable problems with thought-processes that often seem counter-intuitive –  ask stupid questions    embrace constraint  – designers are creating  glimmer moments  – the point when a life-changing idea crystallises in the mind – and coming up with breathtakingly innovative solutions  from a wheelchair that can climb stairs to a $100 laptop for the developing world  from a revolutionary anti-smoking campaign to a bank without queues and a company that makes money giving shoes away for free.

"LONGMAN POCKET ACTIVATOR (pb)2003","The words in the Longman Pocket Activator are organized in groups, based on common words (called Keywords) which express basic ideas. These are listed in alphabetical order. For example all the words that are connected with 'taste', such as delicious, disgusting, spicy, and sweet, are grouped together to TASTE.

It is written by a philosopher but in a quasi-autobiographical style, reflecting the relations between the form of a person's life and the nature of their philosophical reflections. It deals with questions of spirituality, moral feeling, the distinction between theistic and non-theistic religion, the impact of the Death of God controversy, and the nature of Buddhist forms of meditation and their relation to perception and action.

"INTRODUCTION TO VEDANT: UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM (pb)2009","We spend all our Lives in the pursuit of varied pleasures, Wealth and fame expecting these will give us total fulfillment. Yet, each moment of joy is only that: momentary, showing up the rest of our lives to be unsatisfying, somehow lacking and incomplete. On the other hand, Vedanta, the body of Knowledge found at the end of the Veda, asserts with breathtaking boldness that one's true Nature is completeness and limitlessness. Vedanta also promises that moksa liberation from all forms of limitations that seem to bind a human being, is possible here and now.  In this lucid, lively introduction to Vedanta, Swami Dayananda shows how man's constant struggle to overcome these limitations through the ceaseless pursuit of security and pleasure are pre-destined to Failure for the simple reason that they are misdirected: they stem from a failure in understanding the real nature of the fundamental problem itself. All effort howsoever great or unremitting being limited, the result of such effort is also bound to be equally limited, inadequate. The road to freedom from limitation, then, can scarcely lie that way. Indeed, asserts Vedanta, it is only to be found in the correct knowledge of one's true nature as absolute. This vital first step, a clear understanding of man's fundamental problem of ignorance and error about his real nature is what this book is all about.

"MINDLESS EATING: WHY WE EAT MORE THAN WE THINK (pb)2010","It’s not what you eat  its how you eat it… Carefully conducted studies over many years show the same thing: that our eating habits are almost entirely unconscious  and can be influenced by hundreds of outside factors.

By gaining knowledge of your eating habits  he demonstrates that it is entirely possible to lose a stone in weight. While detailing his simple and fascinating studies  Dr. Wansink explains how people don’t eat calories  they eat volume  how we are manipulated by brand and appearance  and what your favourite comfort food says about you.

Author Dr. Bruce Lipton is a former medical school professor and research scientist. His experiments, and that of other leading edge scientists, have examined in great detail the processes by which cells receive information. The implications of this research radically change our understanding of life. It shows that genes and DNA do not control our biology; that instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts. Dr. Lipton’s profoundly hopeful synthesis of the latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics is being hailed as a major breakthrough showing that our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking.

"DESTINY TO DESPAIR (hb)","The writer, Admiral Muhammad Afzal Tahir NI(M) is a former Chief of Naval Staff who spent more than 41 years in service of the country before making a final change in tack to resume civilian life.  His service in the Pakistan Navy took him to lands far and apart thus exposing him to societies and cultures both advanced as well as backward compared to the obtaining native society.  In the last decade of his service in senior ranks he witnessed, from close range, the manifestation of international relations and as Navy Chief, occupied the position of the helmsman of Pakistan's naval diplomacy. As a discerning and educated citizen, he was thus exposed to the monumental developments within the country and internationally spanning last five decades.  Principally, he is deeply disturbed by the steep spiritual as well as behavioral decline of the Pakistani society. In his view, this decline is manifest in our less than honourable behaviour as citizens of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  This decline is evident from our collective conduct as neighbours, as residents, as professionals, as highest to lowest government functionaries, as politicians, as elected representatives, as political activists, as opinion makers, as propagandists, as lawyers, as judges, as doctors, as school teachers, as students, as businessmen, as contractors, as shopkeepers, as vendors, as drivers, as pedestrians, as managers, as workers, as parents, as off springs, and so on. He has endeavoured to track this decline highlighting the reasons for it as he goes along.            He stresses upon an immediate arrest of declining behavioral norms anchored on religious, patriotic and nationalistic pillars, lest it undermine our status as an independent and honourable country.

"THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE, 2e (pb) 2006","The Theory of Knowledge course is central to the philosophy of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. It encourages students to question the basis of knowledge  and to develop the ability to evaluate critically information from a wide range of sources. Unlike most academic courses, where students are used to being given facts that they are  expected to learn, in this course they are expected to question knowledge itself - What do I know? How do I know it? Is it likely to be true or not? Questions that have interested  people over the centuries include: - What is good art? - Can I trust my senses? - Will science tell us everything? - How did the Universe start? - Is there life after death? Theory of Knowledge 2nd edition provides an introductory framework that looks at how to approach these and other questions. It covers ways to look for answers and highlights the problems that arise when we do so. To encourage this critical thinking and to stimulate discussion, this Student's Book also includes a wide range of material from other sources. This new edition includes a variety of new activities in each chapter plus a revised chapter on morality and two new chapters on truth and assessment.

I suppose these questions stormcloud over every marriage: What are you thinking? How are you feeling? Who are you? What have we done to each other? What will we do?' Just how well can you ever know the person you love? This is the question that Nick Dunne must ask himself on the morning of his fifth wedding anniversary when his wife Amy suddenly disappears. The police immediately suspect Nick. Amy's friends reveal that she was afraid of him, that she kept secrets from him. He swears it isn't true. A police examination of his computer shows strange searches. He says they aren't his. And then there are the persistent calls on his mobile phone. So what really did happen to Nick's beautiful wife? And what was in that half-wrapped box left so casually on their marital bed? In this novel, marriage truly is the art of war ...

"THE GREAT SCIENTISTS OF THE WORLD(65 SCIENTISTS COVERED) (pb)","Who is a scientist? Is there any need to explain the term? No, not at all! Everyone knows that scientists are those remarkable human beings who by their contributions-minor or major-in almost every field have made human life more comfortable and successful than ever before. When we go through the human history, we find that in the beginning human life was not as easy and comfortable as it is in the present time. In the ancient times, there were no means of transportation like those, which we see now-a-days. Man had to rely upon his own feet or on traditional means of transport-animals such as horse, donkey, ox, camel, etc. Now, we have bikes, buses, cars, trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, and so on while we need to travel. Means of communication-telephone, cellular phone, television, computer, laptop, Internet, etc. have further enhanced the alleviation of human life. They along with the means of transportation have really made almost every part of the world approachable to everyone.   One of the very basic needs of human beings is the electricity. Without electricity, life is almost impossible. Needless to mention, all major or minor industries across the globe run on electricity. Electrical widgets in our homes make our life much easier. Can we imagine life without them?   All these things are the product of hard work of our scientists. They have made enormous contributions in the advancement of human civilization by dedicating their lives for research and innovation. The Great Scientists of the World endeavours to mention a little about some great scientists and their contributions to the world.

"DOG CRAFTS","Gr. 4-6. Peppy pooches and fetching felines decorate myriad objects in these two companion volumes in the excellent Kids Can Do It series. Jewelry, place mats, toys, and a variety of decorative accessories for both pets and people are among the 17 projects in each volume. Nicely designed, double-page spreads show the project step-by-step, each one clearly and succinctly described and illustrated with a color drawing. The left margin is devoted to a picture of the finished product and a list of required materials, most of which (cardboard, yarn, glue, clay, paint) are readily available. What's just as nice is the level of difficulty: middle-graders (and even some younger children) who like crafts can easily handle most of the projects on their own, though Hendry does occasionally suggest an adult's assistance for safety reasons.

"YOGIC PRANAYAMA: BREATHING FOR LONGLIFE AND GOOD HEALTH (pb) 1997","The book is a complete one of its kind books on Pranayama, an important, yet little known part of Yoga. Breathing exercises are called Pranayamas, which means to control the Prana. Its techniques have been practiced for centuries by ardent students of Yoga in remote ashrams. Pranayama is a very important means for preventing and curing many ailments. By far the most important thing about good breathing is the Prana, or subtle energy of the vital breath. Control of the Prana leads to control of the mind.   The aim of this book is to bring the traditional knowledge of this great art to the common man. It is hoped that by reading this book the reader will be well equipped to keep diseases at bay by using the age-old techniques of Pranayama. Pranayama, the control of the breath, essentially entails the modification of our normal process of breathing. This book is an exhaustive look into the art of breathing. It is complete, detailed and technical.   Yogic Pranayama is one of the most exhaustive, yet understandable book on breath, the physiology of breath, and the effects of proper breathing on the human organism written. The drawings and diagrams in the book are precise, simple and easy to understand.   Author: K.S.

"COMBATING AIDS: COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES IN ACTION (pb)2003","The purpose of this book is to synthesize critical lessons about effective HIV//AIDS prevention programmes, with a major emphasis on communication strategies. The authors feel that despite the growing AIDS crisis, the world is making poor use of behaviour change and communication strategies for HIV//AIDS prevention. To begin with, the role of communication strategies in HIV prevention, care and support has been grossly underestimated. Prevention is shortchanged, despite the fact that no cure for AIDS has been found, and the cost of anti-retroviral therapy is out of reach for most who need it. Many communication strategies are culturally inappropriate, so they may offend public sensitivities, which is easy to do when dealing with a sensitive topic that involves sex, stigma and death. Combating AIDS: Communicaton Strategies in Action focuses on communication strategies that could mobilize political action, target high-risk groups, and overcome stigma. The authors have also described and analyzed the value of entertainment-education strategy in HIV prevention and care, highlighting the use of popular, long-running television and radio soap operas to engage audiences emotionally and create a forum for public debate and discussion.  Focusing on the work being carried out by the individuals and organizations, this book humanizes the AIDS epidemic. Interesting, informative, and readable, this unique book will be of interest to those in the field of community and public health, social medicine, social work and public policy, as well as media professionals and voluntary agencies.

"MEDITATION WEEK BY WEEK: 52 MEDITATIONS TO HELP YOU GROW IN PEACE & AWARENESS (pb)2004","Learning to meditate is a personal  journey, which everyone must undertake at his or her own pace. Best-selling meditation master David Fontana helps us stay committed, inspired, and on track during this inner voyage. Some of the exercises he lays out may take a week to accomplish, while others may require a day, month, year, or even a lifetime. Newcomers and more experienced meditators will both gain fresh insights from these 52 stages. Part One covers beginning meditation and tuning in to self-awareness. The second section focuses on developing concentration and mindfulness. Part Three lays out the path to tranquility, and the fourth and final stage—the most advanced—shows how to develop deep insight into ourselves and the nature of existence.

"LEADERS IN HOMOEOPATHIC THERAPEUTICS (pb)","This work contains Nash's observation and facts he found to be correct and reliable. After reading through writings of Hering, Dunham, Wells, Lippe and all other stalwarts which Nash used in all his practice he says he came to a conclusion of certain symptoms which he found to be more reliable. He has selected all that information from his practice and presents it in this work.This work is considered to be one of the classical works of homeopathy and is also appreciated for the language and the way of presentation of remedies by Nash which makes it a more interesting read.  Author: Dr.Eugene Beauharis Nash, a contemporary of Dr. J.T. Kent, held the torch of homeopathy in the United States at the juncture of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, after stalwarts like Hering, Dunham, Wells, Lippe and others had ceased from their labours and gone to their well earned rest. His well-recognised works offered to the profession covered all aspects of medicine- Leaders for the Use of Sulphur, How to Take the Case, Leaders in Typhoid Fever, Regional Leaders, Selective Clinical Cases, Leaders in Respiratory Organs, Prescriber to Nash Leader and Repertory Based on Allens Keynotes and Nash Leader.

"WHEN A FAMILY MEMBER HAS DEMENTIA STEPS TO BECOMING A RESILIENT CAREGIVER (pb)2006","Caring for a person with dementia is a difficult and often overwhelming task. In addition to the inevitable decline in memory and physical function, most persons with dementia develop one or more troublesome behavior problems, such as depression, fearfulness, sleep disturbances, paranoia, or physical aggression at some point in their disease. Behavioural challenges in dementia are highly idiosyncratic; no two patients are alike, and interventions that work well with one person are often ineffective with another. Caregivers often become stuck; either unable to figure out how best to help their loved one, or unable to consistently implement positive practices that they know would improve their situation.  This book offers caregivers a set of practical and flexible tools to enable them to become resilient in the face of difficulty and change.   Author: Susan M. McCurry","PKR 911.00","SUSAN M.

"PREVENT AND REVERSE HEART DISEASE (pb) 2008","A powerful call for a paradigm shift in heart disease therapy. Based on the groundbreaking results of a twenty-year nutritional study by Dr. Esselstyn, a preeminent researcher and clinician, this book illustrates that a plant-based, oil-free diet can not only prevent and stop the progression of heart disease but can also reverse its effects. The proof lies in the incredible outcomes for patients who have followed Dr. Esselstyns program, including a number of patients in his original study who had been told by their cardiologists that they had less than a year to live. Within months of starting the program, Dr. Esselstyns patients began to improve dramatically, and twenty years later, they remain free of symptoms. Complete with more than 150 delicious recipes, this book explains the science behind the simple plan that has drastically changed the lives of Dr. Esselstyns patients forever. It will empower readers to take control of their heart health.  Drawing on the groundbreaking results of his 20-year nutritional study, the author maintains that a plant-based, oil-free diet can not only prevent and stop the progression of heart disease but can also reverse its effects.

Many of us find ourselves powerless in front of a bag of crisps, a packet of biscuits, the last slice of pizza. Why is it that we simply can't say no? In The End of Overeating David Kessler, the man who took on the tobacco industry, exposes how modern food manufacturers have hijacked the brains of millions by turning our meals into perfectly engineered portions of fat, salt and sugar, turning us into addicts in the process. The result is a ticking time-bomb of growing obesity, heart conditions and a mass of health problems around the globe. Examining why we're so often powerless in the face of such food, Kessler reveals how our appetites have been and are increasingly hijacked by hyper-palatable foods that encourage us to keep eating - all the time. With a special focus on the growing problems in the UK and Europe, Kessler lays out a clear plan and vital tools for reclaiming control over our cravings.

"OVERCOMING STRESS: 30 WAYS TO HANDLE ANXIETY, TENSION AND FRUSTRATION. (pb)2011","30 ways to handle anxiety, tension and frustration.  This book is about positive ideas, healthy attitudes and feeling good. It is about bouncing back to life and not letting everyday tensions, emotional upsets or stressful situations dent your cheerful nature and sunny disposition.  The author, Dr. Christian Schriner, a practicing physiotherapist and an expert in stress management, discusses how you can handle and overcome stress as it happens. Anxiety, frustration and tension often result from our struggling to achieve something positive or resisting the negative, or tensely trying to resolve multiple problems. Based on years of experience, the author shares some of the most effective and successful techniques of rapidly releasing tension and emotional stress: ways of 'letting go'.  All of us have the ability to let go. The book explains how to and how you can. The methods fall under three categories: Relaxers, Distractors and Releasers. All are designed to be effective within 3 minutes or so, and not to interfere with your motivation or energy levels. They will make you feel both relaxed and alert at the same time. With these accelerated stress busters, you can feel good, have fun and go dancing with your mind, rather than fighting with it  Author:Dr. Christan Schriner","PKR 450.00","CHRISTAN SCHRINER",9788122202571,2011,"GENERAL INTEREST > HEALTH/ PHYSICAL FITNESS",1,Paperback,English,160,images/books/9788122202571.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9788122202571&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"MIND OVER MIND: THE SURPRISING POWER OF EXPECTATIONS (pb)2012","We all know expectations matter—in school, in sports, in the stock market. From a healing placebo to a run on the bank, hints of their self-fulfilling potential have been observed for years. But now researchers in fields ranging from medicine to education to criminal justice are moving beyond observation to investigate exactly how expectations work—and when they don’t.   In Mind Over Mind, journalist Chris Berdik offers a captivating look at the frontiers of expectations research, revealing how our brains work in the future tense and how our assumptions—about the next few milliseconds or the next few years—bend reality. We learn how placebo calories can fill us up, why wine judges can’t agree, how fake surgery can sometimes work better than real surgery, and how imaginary power can be corrupting. We meet scientists who have found that wearing taller and more attractive avatars in a virtual world boosts confidence in real life, gambling addicts whose brains make losing feel like winning, and coaches who put blurry glasses on athletes to lift them out of slumps.   Along the way, Berdik probes the paradox of expectations. Their influence seems based on illusion, even trickery, but they can create their own reality, for good or for ill.   Expectations can heal our bodies and make us stronger, smarter, and more successful, or they can leave us in agony, crush our spirit, and undermine our free will. If we can unlock their secrets, we may be able to harness their power and sidestep their pitfalls.   Drawing on psychology, neuroscience, history, and fascinating true stories of xpectations in action, Mind Over Mind offers a spirited journey into one of the most exciting areas of brain research today.  About the Author Chris Berdik is a science journalist and a former staff editor at The Atlantic and Mother Jones.

The books feature full-body anatomy illustrations that reveal the musculature as the body performs a particular exercise. By seeing how the muscles interact and which muscles execute and which support the exercise, the reader gains the greatest understanding of the exercise and its benefits. Anatomy of Running begins with an introduction to the popular fitness activity: Benefits from running Warming up, stretching, cooling down Equipment (shoes, heart rate monitors, pedometers) Surfaces, distances, environment Muscles and ligaments used Stretches and strengthening Common injuries (identification, prevention, treatment, causes) Special considerations (age, pregnancy, fitness level, health).

"DECENTRALIZING HEALTH SERVICES (hb)2014","Current economic, demographic, and environmental shifts are presenting major challenges to health care systems around the world. In response, decentralization--the transfer of control from central to local authorities--is emerging as a successful means of meeting these challenges and reducing inequities of care. But as with health care itself, one size does not fit all, and care systems must be responsive to global reality as well as local demand.     Decentralizing Health Services explores a variety of applications of decentralization to health care delivery in both the developing and developed worlds. Outfitted with principles, blueprints, and examples, this ambitious text clearly sets out the potential role of decentralized care as a major player in public health. Its models of service delivery illustrate care that is effective, inclusive, flexible, and in tune with the current era of preventive and evidence-based healthcare . Contributors point out opportunities, caveats, and controversies as they:      Clarify the relationships among decentralization, politics, and policy Differentiate between political, fiscal, and administrative decentralization in health care systems Consider public/private partnerships in health systems Explain how the effects of decentralization can be evaluated. Present the newest data on the health outcomes of decentralization Explore some challenges and global issues of health systems in the 21st century And each chapter features learning goals, discussion questions, activities, and recommendations for further reading  Heralding changes poised to revolutionize care, Decentralizing Health Services will broaden the horizons of researchers and administrators in health services, health economics, and health policy.

"THE SCANDINAVIAN BELLY FAT PROGRAM: 12 WEEKS (pb)","Jump on board the 12-week program which encourages you to include dark chocolate into your diet, everyday. Did you know that your waistline is your lifeline? Lose the fat around your waist and you live a longer, healthier and happier life. According to Berit Nordstrand, Norwegian physician and mother of six, it's more important for your health to reduce your waist size than to reduce your overall weight. Her advice: get rid of the abdominal fat around your waist that releases all kinds of chemicals and limits your quality of life, shut down the fat cells, stop their emissions, and experience a significant and lasting improvement in your quality of life. If, slowly but surely, the kilos have sneaked up on you, now they will gradually disappear, while you focus a little more on moving, getting enough sleep, relaxation, pleasure and the great taste of pure ingredients. Implement simple 'foodsteps' gradually over a period of 12 weeks and you will change your habits in the longer term, so that you can maintain a stable, ideal weight and good health for the rest of your life. Berit has also included delicious recipes for each week so you can make sure you're sticking to your goals. For example, enjoy Crumble cake and Quick raspberry sorbet in your first week of cutting out added sugar; in week 5 replace white rice and pasta with nutritious recipes like Linsotto with mushrooms and Indian dal; consume the right minerals in week 9 with Oven-roasted chicken with tomato sauce; and munch on Raw chocolate cake whilst sipping on Green tea with honey and ginger in week 10. The Scandinavian Belly Fat Program is packed with tips and tricks which will help you to speed up the burning of fat, increase muscle mass, reposition fat around your body and reach your ideal, healthy waist size.

"THE LAND OF KHYBER (hb)","Khyber, its valley and its people have fascinated many a wanderer, adventurer and poet through the ages. This strange fascination with the land dates back to some of the earliest days of recorded history. The name Khyber, in its own right, has been a source of inspiration for many. The strategic location of the valley as a gateway to the Indian subcontinent does not fully speak of the universal and powerful presence and appeal of this “formidable terrain”. A host of writers have tried capturing the mighty grandeur of the “corridor through which almost all the invasions of the Indian subcontinent took place including those by the Aryans, Alexander’s army, Mahmood of Ghazni, Tamerlane, the Mughals and the Durrani Afghans.” According to Khan, “the range of gaunt and craggy mountains, the gorges and ledges of the Khyber Pass still echo with the thuds of the horses of great conquerors, traders, missionaries and visitors.”From Fahien and Huen Tsang to James W. Spain (The Pathan Borderland and Pathans of the Later Day) to Lowell Thomas (Beyond the Khyber Pass), and finally to A.H. Dani (Romance of the Khyber Pass), many writers, anthropologists, historians and military experts have written on Khyber, highlighting its significance. The book under review is one such addition to the already rich tradition of writing on the glories of the region. Teepu Mahabat Khan does a commendable job at providing first-hand knowledge of the land. He has, in fact, carried on the fading tradition of political officers and administrators (especially during the British period) who would write down accounts of the agencies and districts where they served. In doing so, Khan gives an all-encompassing view of the land. The author has frequently surrendered prose in favour of imagery, using pictures to depict “something majestic” about Khyber which has not been adequately represented in other books on the subject. Some Spanish writers have tried to bring to surface the feeling travellers experience when they are in the valley — but with not much success. Khan, however, manages to bring about a congruity between his words and the magic of the valley. The book shows talks about the essence of the region but, paradoxically, urges the reader to go and visit Khyber; to witness the land in all its glory. Khan, thus, leads readers through the region — a good omen for the growth of tourism. While elaborating upon the features Khyber holds for its visitors, the book provides very useful guidelines to those who wish to marvel at the work of nature. The steam-safari facility has been explained in great detail to invite the traveller to an exciting experience. From geography to history, culture and economy, the book hardly leaves out anything. The Land of Khyber moves from administrative issues to some of the finer aspects of human life with surprising ease. The author brilliantly shifts focus from one thing to another. Starting from the spellbinding effect of the land on Khushhal Khan Khattak, the author does not forget to pay homage to Baba-i-Ghazal, Mir Hamza Khan Shinwari, an important figure in the world of modern literature. “Sta pa anango kae da Hamza da wino sra di Ta shwae da pukhto ghazala zwan za dae baba kram”   Author: Teepu Mahabat Khan  ","PKR 2,500.00","TEEPU MAHABAT KHAN",9693517520,1900,"GENERAL INTEREST > HISTORY",2,"Hard Cover",English,,images/books/9693517520.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9693517520&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"ECOLOGICAL INDIAN MYTH & HISTORY, THE (hb)1999","The idea of the Native American living in perfect harmony with nature is a cherished contemporary myth. In this book Shepard Krech seeks to correct the stereotype. Krech surveys North American environmental history to explore the relation between humans and the rest of nature before and after the arrival of Europeans. He addresses such questions as: were Pleistocene-era humans responsible for the extinction of many large mammals in North America? Did the Hohokam of Arizona destroy their society by over-irrigating and over-salinating theor crops? What role did native Americans play in the near-extinction of the deer, the beaver and the buffalo? How did they use fire?

"THE ARROGANCE OF POWER (pb) 2001","Anthony Summers' biography of Richard Nixon reveals a troubled figure whose criminal behavior did not begin with Watergate. Drawing on more than a thousand interviews and five years of research, Summers reveals a man driven by an addiction to intrigue and power, whose subversion of democracy during Watergate was the culmination of years of cynical political manipulation. New evidence suggests the former president had problems with alcohol and prescription drugs, was at times mentally unstable, and was abusive to his wife Pat. Summers discloses previously unrevealed facts about Nixon's role in the plots to topple Fidel Castro and Salvador Allende, his sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks in l968, and his acceptance of funds from dubious sources. The Arrogance of Power shows how the actions of one tormented man influenced fifty years of American history, in ways still reverberating today.

"AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF SINDH (hb)","‘A valuable addition to the few authentic books available on the subject in the English language’ Hasan Mujtaba, Newsline, March 1994  ‘The political history is interspersed with accounts of the development of the Sindhi language and literature and the spread of Sufism. The book contains references to important articles, books and original sources. Short as the book may appear, it has succinctly given all important information, making it a handy, useful and connected history of Sindh from the earliest days. It will form an important guide for research workers and students of history and literature of Sindh.’ I. A. A., The Nation, 9 December 1994  ‘Suhail Zaheer Lari has done a good job by unfolding details about Sindh which were not hitherto commonly known to people. It is indeed a very profound study.’ Col.

This gives the story a heretical slant and makes it exciting to read. Lari has a historian’s natural bent as you can see in the linear record that his brief book tries to maintain.

"INDIAN RULERS: LORD CLIVE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BRITISH IN INDIA (hb) 2003","The following list represents the works of the last century which I have consulted to write this Life of Lord Clive : Orme's History of Indostan (original edition); The Siyaru-l Muta-akherin of Ghulam Husain Khan (Review of Modern Times), translated copy ; Cambridge's War in India (containing the Journal of Stringer Lawrence); The Memoir of Dupleix (in French); Grose's Voyage to the East Indies; Ive's Voyage and Historical Narrative; Transactions in India from the commencement of the French War in 1756 (published in 1786); Caraccioli's Life of Lord Clive; Vansittart's Narrative of the Transactions in Bengal; Ironside's Narrative of the Military Transactiom in Bengal in 1760-I; Verelst's English Government in Bengal; some numbers of the Asiatic Annual Register; Kindersley's Letters; and Scrafton's Letters; and, for the earlier period-that displaying the period immediately preceding and following the dawn of genius-the recently written extracts from the Madras records by Mr. G.W. Forrest.  Of works of scarcely less value published during the present century, I have consulted the admirable volumes by Colonel Mark Wilks, which bring the History of Southern India down to the storming of Seringapatam in 1799; The Journal of Captain Dalton, one of the heroes of Trichinopoli, written at the period of Clive's early victories, but only given to the world, with a memoir of his career, in 1886; Lord Stanhope's History of England; Malcolm's Life of Clive; and above all, that mine of wealth to a searcher into the details of Olive's services in Bengal, Colonel Broome's History of the Bengal Army. Colonel Broome was my intimate and valued friend. He knew more about the history of the rise of the English in India than any man I ever met. He had made the subject a life-study. He had read every tract, however old, every letter, however difficult to decipher, every record of the period up to and beyond the time of Job Charnock, and he was a past-master of his subject. He had collected an enormous mass of materials, the more bulky of which were dispersed at his untimely death. But I have seen and handled them, and I can state most positively, from my own knowledge, that every item of importance culled from them is contained in the admirable volume to which I have referred, and which was published in 1850. There is, alas, only that volume. Colonel Broome had set apart a vast mass of materials for his second, and had resolved to complete the work at Simla, to which place he was proceeding for the summer of, I think, 1870. But, in the course of transit, the box containing the materials was mysteriously spirited away, and I have not heard that it was ever found. From the nature of the documents collected I cannot but regard the loss as irreparable.  Author: G.B. Malleson / Sir William and Wilson Hunter  ","PKR 2,250.00","G. B.

Mr. Hunter indeed made sure that the task of writing the individual title was entrusted to the most suitable person as is amply reflected by the choice of the authors for the purpose.

"IF BY CHANCE: MAJOR GENERAL JOHN STRAWSON (hb)2003","Could Napoleon have won the battle of Waterloo? And what would have happened if he had? Or suppose Nelson had not destroyed the French fleet at Aboukir, would Napoleon conquered India and become Emperor of the East? What if Hitler had not halted his panzer forces before Dunkirk and had entrapped the entire British Expeditionary Force? How would Churchill have then defeated the Wehrmacht? If by chance Hitler had been assassinated in 1944 and the German General Staff taken control, would there have been a totally different kind of surrender? In examining these and other contingencies, General Strawson brings his experience of command in war and his skill as a military historian to present us with an enthralling catalogue of chance and speculation, while emphasising how profoundly the f commanders influenced events and how events affected their character.

James Achilles Kirkpatrick landed on the shores of eighteenth-century India as an ambitious soldier of the East India Company. Although eager to make his name in the subjection of a nation, it was he who was conquered—not by an army but by a Muslim Indian princess. Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Khair un-Nissa—'Most Excellent among Women'—the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister. He fell in love with Khair, and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company. Possessing all the sweep of a great nineteenth-century novel, White Mughals is a remarkable tale of harem politics, secret assignations, court intrigue, religious disputes and espionage.     Author: William Dalrymple   William Dalrymple was born in Scotland and brought up on the shores of Firth of Forth. He is the author of five books of history and travel, including the highly acclaimed best-seller City of Djinns, which won the 1994 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award and the Sunday Times Young British Writer of the Year Award. His previous book, White Mughals, garnered a range of prizes, including the prestigious Wolfson Prize for History 2003 and the Scottish Book of the Year Prize. It was also shortlisted for the PEN History Award, the Kiriyama Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. A stage version by Christopher Hampton has been co-commissioned by the National Theatre and the Tamasha Theatre Company. A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and of the Royal Asiatic Society, Dalrymple was awarded the 2002 Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society for his 'outstanding contribution to travel literature' and the Sykes Medal of the Royal Society of Asian Affairs in 2005 for his contribution to the understanding of contemporary Islam. He wrote and presented three television series, Stones of the Raj, Sufi Soul and Indian Journeys, the last of which won the Grierson Award for Best Documentary Series at BAFTA in 2002. In December 2005 his article on the madrasas of Pakistan was awarded the prize for Print Article of the Year at the 2005 FPA Media Awards. He is married to the artist Olivia Fraser, and they have three children. They divide their time between London, Scotland and Delhi.

"TWILIGHT OF ATHEISM: THE RISE AND FALL OF DISBELIEF IN THE MODERN WORLD, THE (pb)2005","In this bold and provocative new book, the author of In the Beginning and The Reenchantment of Nature challenges the widely held assumption that the world is becoming more secular and demonstrates why atheism cannot provide the moral and intellectual guidance essential for coping with the complexities of modern life.   Atheism is one of the most important movements in modern Western culture. For the last two hundred years, it seemed to be on the verge of eliminating religion as an outmoded and dangerous superstition. Recent years, however, have witnessed the decline of disbelief and a rise in religious devotion throughout the world. In THE TWILIGHT OF ATHEISM, the distinguished historian and theologian Alister McGrath examines what went wrong with the atheist dream and explains why religion and faith are destined to play a central role in the twenty-first century.  A former atheist who is now one of Christianity’s foremost scholars, McGrath traces the history of atheism from its emergence in eighteenth-century Europe as a revolutionary worldview that offered liberation from the rigidity of traditional religion and the oppression of tyrannical monarchs, to its golden age in the first half of the twentieth century. Blending thoughtful, authoritative historical analysis with incisive portraits of such leading and influential atheists as Sigmund Freud and Richard Dawkins, McGrath exposes the flaws at the heart of atheism, and argues that the renewal of faith is a natural, inevitable, and necessary response to its failures.  THE TWILIGHT OF ATHEISM will unsettle believers and nonbelievers alike. A powerful rebuttal of the philosophy that, for better and for worse, has exerted tremendous influence on Western history, it carries major implications for the future of both religion and unbelief in our society.","PKR 545.00","ALISTER E.

"PARIS: THE SECRET HISTORY (pb)2006","Hussey's cultural history will do for Paris what Peter Ackroyd's book did for London  Paris arouses strong emotions. In its long history it has been variously represented as a prison, a paradise and a vision of hell. As Andrew Hussey shows in this remarkable book, literature is an accurate reflection of daily life: Paris really is made up of violently different spaces and multiple personalities, always at odds with each other and often in noisy collision.   Paris is an account of the city's history from the point of view of those who experienced it - its citizenry. Covering two thousand years, this is a sweeping, vivid portrait of an endlessly fascinating city.   Andrew Hussey is a cultural historian and biographer. His previous book, a critically acclaimed biography of Guy Debord, was published in 2001. He is senior lecturer in French studies at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth and divides his time between Ireland, Wales and Paris.

"THE JESUS DYNASTY: STUNNING NEW EVIDENCE ABOUT THE HIDDEN HISTORY OF JESUS (pb)2006","If you thought Dan Brown's fiction was gripping, try the truth. This controversial book pieces together new evidence on the real life of Jesus. The true inspiration behind Kathy Reich's bestselling thriller, ‘Cross Bones’, archaeologist and scholar James Tabor takes us on a startling journey that changes the story of Christianity as we know it.  Based on hands-on archaeological experience and ground-breaking academic research, real-life Indiana Jones, James Tabor, has produced a compelling and bold new interpretation of the life of Jesus and the origins of Christianity. So revelatory is his work that Kathy Reichs, bestselling mystery writer of the Tempe Brennan series, was inspired by his findings to write her latest novel, ‘Cross Bones’. The truth, however, is far more gripping than fiction – either hers or Dan Brown's.  Tabor's scholarly detective work begins with his accidental discovery on a dig in Israel of what many now think was Jesus' family tomb. Tabor pieces together new archaeological evidence, combined with the earliest surviving Christian documents to reconstruct Jesus' real family history as a royal dynasty in exile. Jesus was leader of a messianic movement – one far different to the revelations of his maverick follower Paul who was responsible for what we know as Christianity today.  Was Jesus far more human than the Church has led us to believe? Was his royal bloodline meant to free mankind or just a chosen few? And why did dissident follower Paul have a more lasting effect on Christianity than Jesus himself? Find out the controversial truth in ‘The Jesus Dynasty’.

"HUGH TREVOR-ROPER: EUROPE's PHYSICIAN (hb)2006","Among the papers of Hugh Trevor-Roper, who died in 2003, was a manuscript to which he had repeatedly turned for more than thirty years, but never published. Attracted by the diverse life and vivid personality of Sir Theodore de Mayerne (1573-1655), the most famous physician in Europe of his time, Trevor-Roper pursued him across national and intellectual frontiers to uncover the details of his extraordinary life. Exploring an array of English and European sources, Trevor-Roper reveals the story of the pioneering Swiss Huguenot doctor who mixed medicine with diplomacy, with political intrigue, with secret intelligence, and with artistic interests at the courts first of Henry IV of France and then of James I and Charles I of England. A true 'renaissance man', Mayerne's interests were broad, and due to considerable conspiratorial talent, he became a participant in bluff and intrigue at the highest levels.

"CALL TO HONOUR: IN SERVICE OF EMERGENT INDIA, A (hb)2006","A Call to Honour: In service of Emergent India is an evocative account about a crucial period in India’s history. After the passing of the Nehruvian era of conservative socialism and non-alignment in international relations India went on to redefine its character and goals in accordance with the demands of a post Cold War world. The BJP-led NDA Government responded to all these issues with a dream for India and a clear vision. As Union Minister of Defense External Affairs and Finance in the BJP-led NDA Government of India Jaswant Singh held many keys to this radical transformation in India’s foreign policy defense policies and economic planning. He handled several critical issues that confronted the country. India’s legitimate security needs found international recognition post-1998. The consequent challenges to Indian statecraft are analyzed in great details in chapters on USA China and Pakistan. He reconstructs the excitement around Pokhran II in May 1998 which provoked strong international reactions. He was a major player in the release of 166 passengers abroad IC814 hijacked to Kandahar and provides a first-hand account of that testing episode. The author has covered in details other equally important events like the Indo-Pak Summit in Agra the Lahore bus journey and the Kargil conflict. The desert of Rajasthan where Jaswant Singh’s home is and where he spend his early years is a kind of a fulcrum of the book. The trauma of Independence continues to haunt many even today. The author visits that period examines the birth of Pakistan and the many changes that came about in its wake. The book takes the reader through the 1999 Kargil conflict and examines the critical environment before and after the war. A call to Honour: In Service of Emergent India is a fluent narrative and provides an in-depth look at several vital events that changed the way the world perceived India. As the millennia changed so did India. This is an account of a part of that transforming journey.   Author: Jaswant Singh has come a long way from his home in the desert districts of Rajasthan. Commissioned in the Indian Army when barely nineteen he went through two wars whilst in service (1962 and 1965 ) before resigning his commission to pursue a political career. He has served seven terms in parliament and in the BJP-led governments of 1996 and 1998-2004 held charges of six ministries of the Government of India including External Affairs Defence and Finance. Regarded as an authority on India foreign policy and national security Jaswant Singh is among the most respected names in the country’s public life and in the world of diplomacy. He is deservedly given credit for dexterously steering India out of the turbulent diplomatic seas encountered in the aftermath of the nuclear tests of May 1998. He is the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha the Upper House of India’s Parliament. Jaswant Singh is a Visiting professor at Oxford University an Honorary Professor at Warwick University and a Senior Fellow at Harvard University. ‘ How do you manage ?’ if asked he replies: ‘ Time always expands to meet the call made upon it’. An ardent and a lifelong bibliophile an antiquarian a prolific writer his personal library is among the most impressive in Lutyens’s Delhi. Amongst his several other pursuits are chess – ‘Best ’ he says ‘to play against a computer you do not mind losing to it’; or golf- sadly ‘shelved these days’ he says ‘too leisurely in these demanding times’ or Polo where he is the current Patron-in-Chief of the Indian Polo Association; and the promotion of Dingal an ancient language of Rajasthan still extant particularly in the arid regions of Marwar and his native Barmer. This is his seventh book. He promises several more ‘They are already in the pipeline.’ ","PKR 1,142.00","JASWANT SINGH",812910976X,2006,"GENERAL INTEREST > HISTORY",1,"Hard Cover",English,426,images/books/812910976X.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=812910976X&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

When you read this text, you will not only learn about American History, you will be exposed to movies and music that tell the stories of American History in addition to the reading material you expect in a college level history book. A highly respected, balanced, and thoroughly modern approach to US History, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, POWER, uses themes in a unique approach to show how the United States was transformed, in a relatively short time, from a land inhabited by hunter-gatherer and agricultural Native American societies into the most powerful industrial nation on earth. This approach helps you understand not only the impact of the notions of liberty and equality, which are often associated with the American story, but also how dominant and subordinate groups have affected and been affected by the ever-shifting balance of power.

"GREEKS AND GREEK LOVE: A RADICAL REAPPRAISAL OF HOMOSEXUALITY IN ANCIENT GREECE, THE (hb)2007","Though the issue of Greek homosexuality has been the subject of extensive research and debate in recent years Kenneth Dover s 1978 GREEK HOMOSEXUALITY remains the most recent single-volume treatment of the subject as a whole. Drawing on fifteen years of ensuing research James Davidson rejects Dover s excessively theoretical approach using a wide variety of sources unknown to him - court cases romantic novels satirical plays and poems - to present a view of the subject that in contrast to Dover and to Foucault stresses the humanity of the ancient Greeks and how they lived their loves and pleasures rather than their moral codes and the theorising of philosophers. Homosexuality in Ancient Greece remains a central area of debate in the classics in ancient history and lesbian and gay studies. Greek civilisation centrally underpins our own providing a basis of so much of the west s culture and philosophy yet the Greeks were more tolerant of homosexuality than virtually any other culture certainly than the western civilisations that followed. The extent to which Greek attitudes to sexuality and in particular their privileging of Greek Love were comparable and different to our own underlies the continuing debate over the formation of sexuality (is it natural or cultural?) as well as both then and in our own time the much wider question of the roles of nature and nurture in the formation of human behaviour and personality.

"A MISSION IN KASHMIR (hb) 2007","Within Weeks Of The Birth Of Independent India, The Kashmir Valley Was In Flames. Indian Troops Were Fighting Against Invading Pathan Tribesmen Who Sought To Claim The Princely State For Pakistan. These Were The First Sparks In A Conflict Which Remains Unresolved.  Attempts To Establish How The Kashmir Dispute First Erupted Have Been Obscured And Impeded By Competing Nationalisms. Retrieving Stories Of Attackers And Survivors, Looters And Looted, Fighters And Civilians, Andrew Whitehead Sets Out To Write A Full And Impartial Account Of How Kashmir Became A Theatre Of War. He Has Gathered A Remarkable Range Of First-Hand Testimonies Of The Most Notorious Episode In The Invasion The Desecration Of A Convent And Mission Hospital In The Riverside Town Of Baramulla-Including One Written By A Missionary Priest And Never Consulted Before.   It Provides A Powerful Human Dimension To What Is Often Seen As A Dispute About Territory. In The Process We Come Closer To Resolving Questions That Have For Decades Been The Subject Of Controversy: Who Were The Invaders? Were They Commanded By Pakistan? What Support Did They Get From Local Kashmiris? And Why, When Srinagar Was At Their Mercy, Did They Fail To Capture The Kashmir Capital?  Apart From Making Brilliant Use Of Oral History, Andrew Whitehead Has Uncovered Archive Documents Which Challenge Both Indian And Pakistani Accounts Of The Genesis Of The Kashmir Dispute. Also Unearthed Is A Letter From Kashmir S Last Maharaja, Written At The Height Of The Crisis, Requesting Immediate Accession To India. Rigorously Researched And Immensely Readable, This Book Not Only Explains How The Kashmir Conflict Started But Also Why It Has Proved So Difficult To Solve.  Author: Andrew Whitehead Andrew K. Whitehead specializes in East-West Comparative Philosophy, particularly concerning the philosophy of Zen Buddhism and phenomenology.

"ONE MINUTE TO MIDNIGHT: KENNEDY, KHRUSHCHEV AND CASTRO ON THE BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR (hb)2008","27 October 1962, was known as 'Black Saturday' around the Kennedy White House. This was a day of nail-biting developments when the hands of the metaphorical Doomsday Clock reached one minute to midnight and the world grew closer than ever before (or since) to nuclear apocalypse. On Black Saturday, two Cold War leaders, John F. Kennedy and Nikita Krushchev, who represented rival ideological and military forces, mobilized their superpowers to fight a nuclear war on land, sea and air, then stepped back from the abyss, just as, in Bobby Kennedy's words, 'there was a feeling that the noose was tightening on all of us, on Americans, on mankind, and that the bridges to escape were crumbling'.Michael Dobbs tells the story of 'Black Saturday' by taking the reader not just into the White House and the Kremlin but along the entire Cold War battlefront. We see inside U-2s and nuclear submarines; the armies gathering in Florida and Cuba; American warships and Cuban anti-aircraft batteries; the CIA, the NSA, the KGB; Cold War radio stations and listening posts; the feverish conspiracies of Cuban exiles; Castro's headquarters; Kruschev's dacha; the underground bunker being prepared for Kennedy; the streets of Washington and Moscow and Havana. Using new archival material, Michael Dobbs brings a fresh perspective to the Cuban missile crisis, an epic moment in the 20th century that witnessed historic decisions, one of the greatest mobilizations of men and equipment since WWII and a cast of characters ranging from the ordinary to the larger than life, all with unique stories to tell.

"AIN'T NOTHING BUT A MAN: MY QUEST TO FIND THE REAL JOHN HENRY (hb)2008","Who was the real John Henry? The story of this legendary African-American figure has come down to us in so many songs, stories, and plays, that the facts are often lost. Historian Scott Nelson brings John Henry alive for young readers in his personal quest for the true story of the man behind the myth. Nelson presents the famous folk song as a mystery to be unraveled, identifying the embedded clues within the lyrics, which he examines to uncover many surprising truths. He investigates the legend and reveals the real John Henry in this beautifully illustrated book. Nelson’s narrative is multilayered, interweaving the story of the building of the railroads, the period of Reconstruction, folk tales, American mythology, and an exploration of the tradition of work songs and their evolution into blues and rock and roll. This is also the story of the author’s search for the flesh-and-blood man who became an American folk hero; Nelson gives a first-person account of how the historian works, showing history as a process of discovery. Readers rediscover an African-American folk hero. We meet John Henry, the man who worked for the railroad, driving steel spikes. When the railroad threatens to replace workers with a steam-powered hammer, John Henry bets that he can drive the beams into the ground faster than the machine. He wins the contest, but dies in the effort. Nelson’s vibrant text, combined with archival images, brings a new perspective and focus to the life and times of this American legend.  Scott Reynolds Nelson is the Legum Professor of History at The College of William and Mary in Virginia. His previous book on John Henry, Steel Drivin’ Man, was awarded the Organization of American Historians Merle Curti Prize and an Anisfield-Wolf award. He lives in Williamsburg, Virginia.","PKR 3,098.00","SCOTT REYNOLDS NELSON",9781426300004,2008,"GENERAL INTEREST > HISTORY",1,"Hard Cover",English,64,images/books/9781426300004.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781426300004&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"ARABS: A HISTORY, THE (hb)2009","Eugene Rogan has written an authoritative new history of the Arabs in the modern world. Starting with the Ottoman conquests in the sixteenth century, this landmark book follows the story of the Arabs through the era of European imperialism and the Superpower rivalries of the Cold War, to the present age of unipolar American power. Drawing on the writings and eyewitness accounts of those who lived through the tumultuous years of Arab history, The Arabs balances different voices - politicians, intellectuals, students, men and women, poets and novelists, famous, infamous and the completely unknown - to give a rich, complex sense of life over nearly five centuries.  Rogan's book is remarkable for its geographical sweep, covering the Arab world from North Africa through the Arabian Peninsula, and for the depth in which it explores every facet of modern Arab history. Charting the evolution of Arab identity from Ottomanism to Arabism to Islamism, it covers themes including the conflict between national independence and foreign domination, the Arab-Israeli struggle and the peace process, Abdel Nasser and the rise of Arab Nationalism, the political and economic power of oil and the conflict between secular and Islamic values.  This multilayered, fascinating and definitive work is the essential guide to understanding the history of the modern Arab world - and its future.

"I ACCUSE: THE ANTI-SIKH VIOLENCE OF 1984 (hb)2009","The unanswered questions  the justice delayed  the unbearable memories—the three days of 1984 when over 3000 Sikhs were slaughtered  have indelibly marked the lives of thousands more who continue to exist in a twilight of bitterness and despair. It was outrage at this state of affairs that led Jarnail Singh  an unassuming  law- abiding journalist  to throw his shoe at home minister P Chidambaram during a press conference in New Delhi. He readily acknowledges that this was not an appropriate means of protest  but asks why  twenty-five years after the massacres  so little has been done to address the issues that are still unresolved and unanswered and a source of anguish to the whole community.    Who initiated the pogrom and why?   Why did the state apparatus allow it to happen?   Why  despite the many commissions and committees set up to investigate the events  have the perpetrators not been brought to book?  <BR> I Accuse is a powerful and passionate indictment of the state’s response to the killings of 1984. It explores the chain of events  the survivors’ stories and the continuing shadow it casts over their lives. Because  finally  1984 was not an attack on the Sikh community alone; it was an attack on the idea at the very core of democracy—that every citizen  irrespective of faith and community  has a right to life  liberty and security.

"BEAUTIFUL SICHUAN: BEFORE AND AFTER THE GREAT WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE (hb) 2009","Located in southwestern China, Sichuan is known as the land of abundance and beauty, boasting a long history, dazzlingly rich and colorful plains, precipitous natural landscapes, and exotic ethnic cultures. On May 12, 2008, the province experienced an extraordinarily powerful and devastating earthquake that caused heavy casualties and rendered tremendous damages to its infrastructure. The sufferings caused by the massive earthquake were relieved through the quick and intensive efforts of the Chinese civilians, army, and government, as well as international relief agencies.   Today, post-earthquake Sichuan is as beautiful as ever. Many of the world cultural heritage sites in the province survived the disaster. The Jiuzhai Valley, the Huanglong Scenic and Historical Interest Area, Leshan s Scenic Spot, and Mount Emei were hardly affected. The well-known ancient Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which was built over 2,000 years ago, was only slightly damaged. The province s diverse ethnic cultures have also survived the earthquake. In a word, the earthquake has exerted little influence on the area s cultural tourism.  This book is arranged in the order of time and space in order to present the charm and beauty of Sichuan Province to readers across the world. It consists of four chapters. The first chapter provides an overview of the historical events that took place in Sichuan. The other three chapters introduce the topographic features and regional cultures through the descriptions of mountains, rivers, and ethnic minorities. The narratives of these chapters weave nature with humanity, aiming to help readers understand the humanistic landscape they will experience in the province.

Days of the Raj reproduces first-hand accounts of home-sickness, club culture, mountaineering, Christmas and station parties, and also records British responses to nautch girls and the zenana, mountains and the Ganga, fairs and festivals, elephants and mosquitoes and the monsoon.

"PHILOSOPHER'S QUARREL, THE (pb)2009","The rise and spectacular fall of the friendship between the two great philosophers of the eighteenth century, barely six months after they first met, reverberated on both sides of the Channel. As the relationship between Jean-Jacques Rousseau and David Hume unraveled, a volley of rancorous letters was fired off, then quickly published and devoured by aristocrats, intellectuals, and common readers alike. Everyone took sides in this momentous dispute between the greatest of Enlightenment thinkers.   In this lively and revealing book, Robert Zaretsky and John T. Scott explore the unfolding rift between Rousseau and Hume. The authors are particularly fascinated by the connection between the thinkers’ lives and thought, especially the way that the failure of each to understand the other—and himself—illuminates the limits of human understanding. In addition, they situate the philosophers’ quarrel in the social, political, and intellectual milieu that informed their actions, as well as the actions of the other participants in the dispute, such as James Boswell, Adam Smith, and Voltaire. By examining the conflict through the prism of each philosopher’s contribution to Western thought, Zaretsky and Scott reveal the implications for the two men as individuals and philosophers as well as for the contemporary world.  Robert Zaretsky is professor of French, Honors College, University of Houston. John T. Scott is professor of political science, University of California, Davis. Zaretsky and Scott are also coauthors of  Frail Happiness: An Essay on Rousseau.","PKR 2,942.00","ROBERT ZARETSKY",9780300164282,2009,"GENERAL INTEREST > HISTORY",1,Paperback,English,247,images/books/9780300164282.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780300164282&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"BLOOD & FAITH: THE PURGING OF MUSLIM SPAIN, 1492-1614 (hb)2009","In April 1609, King Philip III of Spain signed an edict denouncing the Muslim inhabitants of Spain as heretics, traitors, and apostates. Later that year, the entire Muslim population of Spain was given three days to leave Spanish territory, on threat of death. In a brutal and traumatic exodus, entire families and communities were obliged to abandon homes and villages where they had lived for generations, leaving their property in the hands of their Christian neighbors. In Aragon and Catalonia, Muslims were escorted by government commissioners who forced them to pay whenever they drank water from a river or took refuge in the shade. For five years the expulsion continued to grind on, until an estimated 300,000 Muslims had been removed from Spanish territory, nearly 5 percent of the total population. By 1614 Spain had successfully implemented what was then the largest act of ethnic cleansing in European history, and Muslim Spain had effectively ceased to exist.

"BIRTH OF CLASSICAL EUROPE: A HISTORY FROM TROY TO AUGUSTINE, THE (hb)2010","To an extraordinary extent we continue to live in the shadow of the classical world. At every level from languages to calendars to political systems, we are the descendants of a 'classical Europe', using frames of reference created by ancient Mediterranean cultures. As this consistently fresh and surprising new book makes clear, however, this was no less true for the inhabitants of those classical civilizations themselves, whose myths, history, and buildings were an elaborate engagement with an already old and revered past filled with great leaders and writers, emigrations and battles. Indeed, much of the reason we know so much about the classical past is the obsessive importance it held for so many generations of Greeks and Romans, who interpreted and reinterpreted their changing casts of heroes and villains. Figures such as Alexander the Great and Augustus Caesar loom large in our imaginations today, but they were themselves fascinated by what had preceded them.  The Birth of Classical Europe is therefore both an authoritative history, and also a fascinating attempt to show how our own changing values and interests have shaped our feelings about an era which is by some measures very remote but by others startlingly close.

"THE STORM OF WAR: A NEW HISTORY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR (pb)2010","On 2 August 1944 Winston Churchill mocked Adolf Hitler in the House of Commons by the rank he had reached in the First World War. 'Russian success has been somewhat aided by the strategy of Herr Hitler, of Corporal Hitler,' Churchill jibed. 'Even military idiots find it difficult not to see some faults in his actions.'  Andrew Roberts's previous book Masters and Commanders studied the creation of Allied grand strategy; The Storm of War now analyses how Axis strategy evolved. Examining the Second World War on every front, Roberts asks whether, with a different decision-making process and a different strategy, the Axis might even have won. Were those German generals who blamed everything on Hitler after the war correct, or were they merely scapegoating their former Führer once he was safely beyond defending himself? The book is full of illuminating sidelights on the principle actors that bring their characters and the ways in which they reached decisions into fresh focus.

"CARTHAGE MUST BE DESTROYED: THE RISE & FALL OF AN ANCIENT CIVILIZATION (hb)2010","The devastating struggle to the death between the Carthaginians and Romans was one of the defining dramas of the Ancient World.  In an epic series of land and sea battles both sides came close to victory before the Carthaginians finally buckled and their capital city, history and culture were almost utterly erased.  The last great threat to Roman supremacy across the entire Mediterranean had gone, fulfilling Cato the Elder's insistent demand 'Carthage must be destroyed'.  Carthage Must Be Destroyed' brilliantly brings to life this lost empire – from its origins among the Phoenician settlements of Lebanon to its apotheosis as the greatest sea-power in the Mediterranean, with interests stretching from the Middle East to southern Spain.  Roman ferocity tried to remove Carthage from history, but it is possible nonetheless to create an extraordinary narrative of a civilization which left an indelible, if often hidden legacy for those that followed.  At the heart of all attempts to understand Carthage must lie the extraordinary figure of Hannibal – the scourge of Rome and one of the greatest, most charismatic and innovative of all military leaders, but a man also who ultimately led his people to catastrophe.  Drawing on a wealth of new archaeological research, Richard Miles makes Carthage vivid as it has never been before.

"LEGACY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR (pb)2010","Sixty-five years after the conclusion of World War II, its consequences are still with us. In this probing book, the acclaimed historian John Lukacs raises perplexing questions about World War II that have yet to be explored. In a work that brilliantly argues for World War II’s central place in the history of the twentieth century, Lukacs applies his singular expertise toward addressing the war’s most persistent enigmas.   The Second World War was Hitler’s war. Yet questions about Hitler’s thoughts and his decisions still remain. How did the divisions of Europe—and, consequently, the Cold War—come about? What were the true reasons for Werner Heisenberg’s mission to Niels Bohr in Copenhagen in September 1941? What led to “Rainbow Five,” the American decision to make the war against Germany an American priority even in the event of a two-ocean world war? Was the Cold War unavoidable? In this work, which offers both an accessible primer for students and challenging new theses for scholars, Lukacs addresses these and other riddles, revealing the ways in which the war and its legacy still touch our lives today.

"SWORD OF PERSIA: NADER SHAH, FROM TRIBAL WARRIOR TO CONQUERING TYRANT, THE (pb)2010","Nader Shah, ruler of Persia from 1736 to 1747, embodied ruthless ambition, energy, military brilliance, cynicism and cruelty. His reign was filled with bloodshed, betrayal and horror. Yet Nader Shah is central to Iran's early modern history. From a shepherd boy he rose to liberate his country from foreign occupation, and make himself Shah. He took eighteenth-century Iran from political collapse to become the dominant power in the region, recovering Herat and Kandahar, conquering Moghul Delhi, plundering the enormous treasures of India, repeatedly defeating Ottoman Turkey, and overrunning most of what is now Iraq. But suspicion and avarice led him to persecute the Persian people as savagely as any foreign conqueror had done. The Sword of Persia recreates the story of a remarkable, ruthless man, capable of both charm and brutality, who became a monster of insane cruelty. It is a rich narrative, full of dramatic incident, including much new research into original Iranian and other material, which will prove indispensable to historians and students.  About the Author Michael Axworthy teaches Middle East history at Exeter University. Before deciding on an academic career he was head of the Iran Section in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and has frequently travelled to Iran, both as a diplomat and an historian.

"INDIAN PAINTINGS IN THE SARABHAI FOUNDATION (hb)2010","The paintings to which this volume serves as a catalogue belonged once to one or the other member of the Sarabhai family. But, compared to so many other distinguished collections which the family owned, and later gifted either to the Calico Museum of Textiles or the Sarabhai Foundation of textiles, pichhwais, manuscripts, Jain artifacts, and south Indian bronzes, among them they have remained little known till now.There is no dominant theme that runs through the collection, and paintings may not, by themselves, have been a dominant passion in the life of the Sarabhais, but the works they collected reflect great discrimination and aesthetic sensibility. What is more, in the collection there is remarkable breadth and even the casual viewer would be struck by the well-rounded view it offers of the broad historical development of Indian painting, There are works here that come from as early as the 11 th century and as late as the 19th; small Pala works on palm-leaf jostle here against some of the earliest works done on paper when that material came into use; Mughal works like those from some of the most celebrated series like the Hamza Nama or the Padshahnama stand close to dazzling folios from the so-called 'Palam' Bhagavata; the painter Chokha of Deogarh figures in the collection as much as the great Nainsukh of Guler does.

Over the last few centuries, new democratic movements have led to the emancipation of women, slaves, and the oppressed. But what drove these modern changes, Appiah argues, was not imposing legislation from above, but harnessing the ancient power of honor from within.

"PERSIANS: ANCIENT, MEDIAEVAL AND MODERN IRAN, THE (pb)2010","In recent years, Iran has gained attention mostly for negative reasons—its authoritarian religious government, disputed nuclear program, and controversial role in the Middle East—but there is much more to the story of this ancient land than can be gleaned from the news. This authoritative and comprehensive history of Iran, written by Homa Katouzian, an acclaimed expert, covers the entire history of the area from the ancient Persian Empire to today’s Iranian state.  Writing from an Iranian rather than a European perspective, Katouzian integrates the significant cultural and literary history of Iran with its political and social history. Some of the greatest poets of human history wrote in Persian—among them Rumi, Omar Khayyam, and Saadi—and Katouzian discusses and occasionally quotes their work. In his thoughtful analysis of Iranian society, Katouzian argues that the absolute and arbitrary power traditionally enjoyed by Persian/Iranian rulers has resulted in an unstable society where fear and short-term thinking dominate.

In this immensely readable and thoroughly researched book, Tarek Osman explores what has happened to the biggest Arab nation since President Nasser took control of the country in 1954. He examines Egypt's central role in the development of the two crucial movements of the period, Arab nationalism and radical Islam; the increasingly contentious relationship between Muslims and Christians; and perhaps most important of all, the rift between the cosmopolitan elite and the mass of the undereducated and underemployed population, more than half of whom are aged under thirty.

"TURKEY, ISLAM, NATIONALISM, AND MODERNITY: A HISTORY, 1789-2007 (hb)2010","Turkey, Islam, Nationalism, and Modernity reveals the historical dynamics propelling two centuries of Ottoman and Turkish history. As mounting threats to imperial survival necessitated dynamic responses, ethnolinguistic and religious identities inspired alternative strategies for engaging with modernity. A radical, secularizing current of change competed with a conservative, Islamically committed current. Crises sharpened the differentiation of the two currents, forcing choices between them.   The radical current began with the formation of reformist governmental elites and expanded with the advent of “print capitalism,” symbolized by the privately owned, Ottoman-language newspapers. The radicals engineered the 1908 Young Turk revolution, ruled empire and republic until 1950, made secularism a lasting “belief system,” and still retain powerful positions.   The conservative current gained impetus from three history-making Islamic renewal movements, those of Mevlana Halid, Said Nursi, and Fethullah Gülen. Powerful under the empire, Islamic conservatives did not regain control of government until the 1980s. By then they, too, had their own influential media.   Findley's reassessment of political, economic, social, and cultural history reveals the dialectical interaction between radical and conservative currents of change, which alternately clashed and converged to shape late Ottoman and republican Turkish history.

"NOT THE ENEMY: ISRAEL's JEWS FROM ARAB LANDS (pb) 2010","In this remarkable, page-turning book, Rachel Shabi lays bare the painful division within Israeli society between Ashkenazi Jews, whose families come from Eastern Europe, and Sephardic or Mizrahi Jews, who come from the Arab countries of the Middle East. Herself from an Iraqi Jewish family, Shabi explores the history of this relationship, tracing it back to the first days of the new state of Israel. In a society desperate to identify itself with Europe, immigrants who spoke Arabic and followed Middle Eastern customs were seen as inferior; David Ben Gurion, Israel's first prime minister, famously described them as 'human dust'. Sixty years later, Mizrahis are still much less successful than Ashkenazis, condemned, often, to substandard education, low-quality housing and mockery for their accents, tastes and lifestyles. Through a combination of archival research and personal interviews, Shabi brings to light the prejudices that permeate Israeli society and demonstrates how they affect Mizrahi lives and hopes. Even more importantly, she argues that the treatment meted out to Mizrahis reflects a wider Israeli rejection of the Middle East and its culture, a rejection that makes it impossible for Israel ever to become integrated within its own region.  Rachel Shabi was born in Israel to Iraqi Jews and grew up in Britain.

"DECLINE & FALL OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC, THE (hb)2010","Bruce Ackerman shows how the institutional dynamics of the last half-century have transformed the American presidency into a potential platform for political extremism and lawlessness. Watergate, Iran-Contra, and the War on Terror are only symptoms of deeper pathologies. ­Ackerman points to a series of developments that have previously been treated independently of one another—from the rise of presidential primaries, to the role of pollsters and media gurus, to the centralization of power in White House czars, to the politicization of the military, to the manipulation of constitutional doctrine to justify presidential power-grabs. He shows how these different transformations can interact to generate profound constitutional crises in the twenty-first century—and then proposes a series of reforms that will minimize, if not eliminate, the risks going forward.  The book aims to begin a new constitutional debate. Americans should not suppose that Barack Obama’s centrism and constitutionalism will typify the presidencies of the twenty-first century. We should seize the present opportunity to confront deeper institutional pathologies before it is too late.

"GLOBISH: HOW THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BECOME THE WORLD's LANGUAG (hb) 2010","It seems impossible: a small island in the North Atlantic, colonized by Rome, then pillaged for hundreds of years by marauding neighbors, becomes the dominant world power in the nineteenth century. Equally unlikely, a colony of that island nation, across the Atlantic, grows into the military and cultural colossus of the twentieth century. How? By the sword, of course; by trade and industrial ingenuity; but principally, and most surprisingly, by the power of their common language.   In this provocative and compelling new look at the course of empire, Robert McCrum, coauthor of the best-selling book and television series The Story of English, shows how the language of the Anglo-American imperium has become the world’s lingua franca. In fascinating detail he describes the ever-accelerating changes wrought on the language by the far-flung cultures claiming citizenship in the new hegemony.

"SECULAR JINNAH AND PAKISTAN; WHAT THE NATION DOESN'T KNOW (hb)","In 2005, Saleena Karim raised controversy when she proved that a famous quote of M.A. Jinnah used in Chief Justice Munir's From Jinnah to Zia (1979) was a fake. In this much-anticipated sequel to Secular Jinnah (2005), the author provides an in-depth analysis of the ‘Munir quote’ and its extraordinary influence over those who argue for a 'Secular Jinnah'. Containing independent and original research collected over five years, her book presents a compelling case for a Jinnah who was neither a secularist, nor a religionist, nor even a product of secular-Islam synthesis.  This comprehensive work includes discussions on: • Jinnah’s ‘ideological’ conversion • Iqbal’s intellectual influence • The real meaning of the Two-Nation Theory • The Lahore Resolution as a ‘deferred’ partition demand • The Cabinet Mission Plan • The Objective Resolution of 1949 • Academic misconstruction of Jinnah  Plus exclusive never-before-published research including: • Account of the first and devastating use of the Munir quote in the Constituent Assembly debates of 1954. • The untold story of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2006 to make the 11 August 1947 speech a substantive part of the Pakistani constitution (includes correspondence between S.Karim and late M.P.

"INDIA: A WOUNDED CIVILIZATION (pb)","In 1975, at the height of Indira Gandhi’s “Emergency,” V. S. Naipaul returned to India, the country his ancestors had left one hundred years earlier. Out of that journey he produced this concise masterpiece: a vibrant, defiantly unsentimental portrait of a society traumatized by centuries of foreign conquest and immured in a mythic vision of its past.  Drawing on novels, news reports, political memoirs, and his own encounters with ordinary Indians–from a supercilious prince to an engineer constructing housing for Bombay’s homeless–Naipaul captures a vast, mysterious, and agonized continent inaccessible to foreigners and barely visible to its own people. He sees both the burgeoning space program and the 5,000 volunteers chanting mantras to purify a defiled temple; the feudal village autocrat and the Naxalite revolutionaries who combined Maoist rhetoric with ritual murder. Relentless in its vision, thrilling in the keenness of its prose, India: A Wounded Civilization is a work of astonishing insight and candor. ","PKR 461.00","V. S.

"CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE STATE THAT FAILED (pb)2011","This book, the most thoroughly researched and accurate history of Czechoslovakia to appear in English, tells the story of the country from its founding in 1918 to partition in 1992—from fledgling democracy through Nazi occupation, Communist rule, and invasion by the Soviet Union to, at last, democracy again.   The common Western view of Czechoslovakia has been that of a small nation that was sacrificed at Munich in 1938 and betrayed to the Soviets in 1948, and which rebelled heroically against the repression of the Soviet Union during the Prague Spring of 1968. Mary Heimann dispels these myths and shows how intolerant nationalism and an unhelpful sense of victimhood led Czech and Slovak authorities to discriminate against minorities, compete with the Nazis to persecute Jews and Gypsies, and pave the way for the Communist police state. She also reveals Alexander Dubcek, held to be a national hero and standard-bearer for democracy, to be an unprincipled apparatchik. Well written, revisionist, and accessible, this groundbreaking book should become the standard history of Czechoslovakia for years to come.

"PASHAS: TRADERS AND TRAVELLERS IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD (pb)2011","Runner up for the 2010 Longman-History Today Book of the Year Award presented by History Today. Long before they came as occupiers, the British were drawn to the Middle East by the fabled riches of its trade and the enlightened tolerance of its people. The Pashas, merchants and travelers from Europe, discovered an Islamic world that was alluring, dynamic, and diverse. Ranging across two and a half centuries and through the great cities of Istanbul, Aleppo, and Alexandria, James Mather tells the forgotten story of the men of the Levant Company who sought their fortunes in the Ottoman Empire. Their trade brought to the region not only merchants but also ambassadors and envoys, pilgrims and chaplains, families and servants, aristocratic tourists and roving antiquarians. Unlike the nabobs who gathered their fortunes in Bengal, they both respected and learned from the culture they encountered, and their lives provide a fascinating insight into the meeting of East and West before the age of European imperialism.Intriguing, intimate, and original, Pashas brings to life an extraordinary tale of faraway visitors beguiled by a mysterious world of Islam.   James Mather graduated from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, before studying at Harvard as a Kennedy scholar. He now works as a commercial barrister in London.

"IDEA OF AMERICA: REFLECTIONS AN THE BIRTH OF THE UNITED STATES, THE (hb)2011","More than almost any other nation in the world, the United States began as an idea. For this reason, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Gordon S. Wood believes that the American Revolution is the most important event in our history, bar none. Since American identity is so fluid and not based on any universally shared heritage, we have had to continually return to our nation's founding to understand who we are. In The Idea of America, Wood reflects on the birth of American nationhood and explains why the revolution remains so essential.   In a series of elegant and illuminating essays, Wood explores the ideological origins of the revolution-from ancient Rome to the European Enlightenment-and the founders' attempts to forge an American democracy. As Wood reveals, while the founders hoped to create a virtuous republic of yeoman farmers and uninterested leaders, they instead gave birth to a sprawling, licentious, and materialistic popular democracy.   Wood also traces the origins of American exceptionalism to this period, revealing how the revolutionary generation, despite living in a distant, sparsely populated country, believed itself to be the most enlightened people on earth. The revolution gave Americans their messianic sense of purpose-and perhaps our continued propensity to promote democracy around the world-because the founders believed their colonial rebellion had universal significance for oppressed peoples everywhere. Yet what may seem like audacity in retrospect reflected the fact that in the eighteenth century republicanism was a truly radical ideology-as radical as Marxism would be in the nineteenth-and one that indeed inspired revolutionaries the world over.   Today there exists what Wood calls a terrifying gap between us and the founders, such that it requires almost an act of imagination to fully recapture their era. Because we now take our democracy for granted, it is nearly impossible for us to appreciate how deeply the founders feared their grand experiment in liberty could evolve into monarchy or dissolve into licentiousness. Gracefully written and filled with insight, The Idea of America helps us to recapture the fears and hopes of the revolutionary generation and its attempts to translate those ideals into a working democracy.

"FOR THE LOVE OF A SON: ONE AFGHAN WOMAN'S QUEST FOR HER STOLEN CHILD (pb)2011","From the time she was a little girl, Maryam rebelled against the terrible second-class existence that was her destiny as an Afghan woman. She had witnessed the miserable fate of her grandmother and three aunts, and wished she had been born a boy. As a feisty teenager in Kabul, she was outraged when the Russians invaded her country. After she made a public show of defiance, she had to flee the country for her life. A new life of freedom seemed within her grasp,but her father arranged a traditional marriage to a fellow Afghan, who turned out to be a violent man. Beaten, raped and abused, Maryam found joy in the birth of a baby son. But then her brutal husband stole him away far beyond his mother's reach. For many long years she searched for her lost son, while civil war and Taliban oppression raged back home in Afghanistan. Set against a landscape littered with tragic tales of horrific suffering, Jean Sasson, author of Princess, chronicles the story of one resolute but tormented woman determined to achieve freedom and equality with men.  About the Author Jean Sasson is the sharp-eyed and compassionate chronicler of women's lives in the Muslim world.

"IN ISHMAEL'S HOUSE: A HISTORY OF JEWS IN MUSLIM LANDS (pb)2011","The relationship between Jews and Muslims has been a flashpoint that affects stability in the Middle East and has consequences around the globe. In this absorbing and eloquent book, Martin Gilbert challenges the standard media portrayal and presents a fascinating account of hope, opportunity, fear, and terror that have characterized these two people through the 1,400 years of their intertwined history. Harking back to the Biblical story of Ishmael and Isaac, Gilbert takes the reader from the origins of the fraught relationship - the refusal of Medina's Jews to accept Mohammed as a prophet - through the ages of the Crusader reconquest of the Holy Land and the great Muslim sultanates to the present day. He explores the impact of Zionism in the first half of the twentieth century, the clash of nationalisms during the Second World War, the mass expulsions and exodus of 800,000 Jews from Muslim lands following the birth of Israel, the Six-Day War and its aftermath, and the political sensitivities of the current Middle East.

"ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF THE LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD 4-VOLS SET (hb)2011","The study of language, as a science in itself, has attracted, so far, but very little attention in many countries of the world. Indeed, it would be quite impossible for the student, however great his interest in the subject might be, to find the means with which to prosecute his inquiries. There are very few works which are devoted exclusively to this subject — we know of not a single general or comprehensive work similar to the one before the reader; nor do the works of English authors present us with anything like a complete view of the subject. There is, then, a want, which is every day felt, of a work which shall give a fair view of the present state of philological science, which shall initiate the inquiring student into the mysteries of language, and inform him of its wonders and its beauties, of a work which shall be complete in itself, and which shall not imply anything else than a knowledge of the English and a disposition on the part of the learner to study and reflect, a work which shall be simple and plain enough for anybody to read, and yet thorough and philosophical enough for even the experienced philologist to study with advantage. It is to be hoped that this may be found the work desired. No effort, no expense, has been spared by the authors to render this work deserving of the attention and confidence of the student, and to make it complete, accurate, and intelligible. The most important part of the whole work is the comparative view of the history and idioms of the principal languages of the world. It is believed that nothing can so well instruct us in the true nature of language, as the manner in which the different classes of people, or nations, express their ideas. Here, the selections have been very copious, and no pains have been spared to render their character and meaning easily understood. The subject of Etymology has, also, been thoroughly treated of, and the rules by which we may trace the connexion of words, have been carefully set forth. The large lists of words under this head must prove very instructive to anyone who carefully examines them. The main object of the work has been to present a comparative view of the different languages of the world, and, besides, such facts as would best instruct the student in the nature of language. But, to make the work complete, we have some-times felt it necessary to discuss, philosophically, some of the questions in philology.  by Mario a Pei","PKR 20,767.00","MARIO A PEI",9788130715285,2011,"GENERAL INTEREST > HISTORY",1,"Hard Cover",English,1157,images/books/9788130715285.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9788130715285&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"RISE OF WESTERN MILITARY POWER (hb)2011","This expansive book surveys the history of warfare from ancient Mesopotamia to the Gulf War in search of a deeper understanding of the origins of Western warfare and the reasons for its eminence today. Historian John France explores the experience of war around the globe, in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. His bold conclusions cast doubt on well-entrenched attitudes about the development of military strength, the impact of culture on warfare, the future of Western dominance, and much more.   Taking into account wars waged by virtually all civilizations since the beginning of recorded history, France finds that despite enormous cultural differences, war was conducted in distinctly similar ways right up to the Military Revolution and the pursuit of technological warfare in the nineteenth century. Since then, European and American culture has shaped warfare, but only because we have achieved a sense of distance from it, France argues. He warns that the present eminence of U.S. power is much more precarious and accidental than commonly believed. The notion that war is a distant phenomenon is only an illusion, and our cultural attitudes must change accordingly.   John France is professor emeritus, Department of History and Classics, Swansea University. He is author of The Crusades and the Expansion of Catholic Christendom, among numerous other books and articles.

"BIRTH OF CLASSICAL EUROPE: A HISTORY FROM TROY TO AUGUSTINE, THE (pb)2011","We still live in the shadow of the classical world.  At every level from languages to calendars to political systems, we are the descendants of a 'classical Europe', using frames of reference created by ancient Mediterranean cultures.  Tracing the epic sweep of classical history from Bronze Age Crete through to early Christianity, this compelling and comprehensive work shows how the inhabitants of the classical world were also themselves living in the shadow of an ancient past. Their myths, art and buildings looked back to an already revered history filled with great leaders, writers and battles, and generations of Greeks and Romans – including figures such as Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar – obsessively reinterpreted their changing casts of heroes and villains.

Are modern humans a distinct species from ancient people such as the Neanderthals? And what contact did our ancestors have with them? How can we recognise modern humans behaviourally, and were traits such as complex language and art unique to modern humans? What forces shaped the origins of modern humans - were they climatic, dietary, social, or even volcanic? What drove the dispersals of modern humans from Africa, and how did our species spread over the globe? How did regional features evolve, and how significant are they? What exactly was the 'Hobbit' of the island of Flores, and how was it related to us? Has human evolution stopped, or are we still evolving? What can we expect from future research on our origins?

Entertaining books and movies often depict Freemasonry as a shadowy, mysterious, and possibly sinister organization, and the TV and magazine specials on Freemasonry that inevitably follow often leave us with more questions than answers.

It may be the single most reliable short guide to Masonry, written by a widely recognized psychologist and scholar of esoteric history.   Koltko-Rivera's trustworthy handbook explores all the basic issues around Masonry, like:   * What is Freemasonry, and what is its history?  * How does one become a Freemason?  * What are some of the most important Masonic symbols?  * What do Masons get from their involvement in Freemasonry? What changes does it make in their inner and outer lives?  * What is it like to participate in the initiatory rituals of Freemasonry?  * What are some of the great historical controversies and myths surrounding Freemasonry?  * How is Masonry relevant today?

His intellectual and moral legacy, and the example of his life and politics, serve as an inspiration to human rights and peace movements, political activists and students. This book, comprised of essays by renowned experts in the fields of Indian history and philosophy, traces Gandhi's extraordinary story. The first part of the book explores his transformation from a small-town lawyer during his early life in South Africa into a skilled political activist and leader of civil resistance in India. The second part is devoted to Gandhi's key writings and his thinking on a broad range of topics, including religion, conflict, politics and social relations.

"WHY EUROPE GREW RICH AND ASIA DID NOT GLOBAL ECONOMIC DIVERGENCE, 1600-1850 (hb)2011","Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not provides a striking new answer to the classic question of why Europe industrialised from the late eighteenth century and Asia did not. Drawing significantly from the case of India, Prasannan Parthasarathi shows that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the advanced regions of Europe and Asia were more alike than different, both characterized by sophisticated and growing economies. Their subsequent divergence can be attributed to different competitive and ecological pressures that in turn produced varied state policies and economic outcomes. This account breaks with conventional views, which hold that divergence occurred because Europe possessed superior markets, rationality, science or institutions. It offers instead a groundbreaking rereading of global economic development that ranges from India, Japan and China to Britain, France and the Ottoman Empire and from the textile and coal industries to the roles of science, technology and the state.

"HUMANITARIAN INTERVENTION: A HISTORY (hb)2011","The dilemma of how best to protect human rights is one of the most persistent problems facing the international community today. This unique and wide-ranging history of humanitarian intervention examines responses to oppression, persecution and mass atrocities from the emergence of the international state system and international law in the late sixteenth century, to the end of the twentieth century. Leading scholars show how opposition to tyranny and to religious persecution evolved from notions of the common interests of 'Christendom' to ultimately incorporate all people under the concept of 'human rights'. As well as examining specific episodes of intervention, the authors consider how these have been perceived and justified over time, and offer important new insights into ideas of national sovereignty, international relations and law, as well as political thought and the development of current theories of 'international community'.

In Ippy’s Chronicles, he brings forth ghosts and demons that we in Pakistan often forget or choose not to see. In the process, he conjures up a lively mix of his more than ordinary personal life, the stormy political and historical events and the evolving confusions that define our culture now. He has described his wholesome story in a way that it has become the story of Pakistan- a topsy-turvy, one-step-forward-two-backward journey to, well, nowhere. And he has written it in a style which is ‘unputdownable,’ perhaps introducing a new genre in native English literature.

"HERITAGE OF HAIDER LAI AND TIPU SULTAN ART AND ARCHITECTURE (hb)2012","This book is a pioneering work on an area which has received scant attention in the past. Studies on the period of Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan - the 'Mysore Sultans' inevitably focus on the dominant narrative of political history of the time and its attendant romantic anecdotes. Consequently, the study of art and architecture of the period has so far remained in the shadows. This book is a detailed aesthetic study of the art and architecture of the palaces, forts, mosques, mausoleum at Srirangapatna, Bangalore and the neighbourhood. Further, this book closely examines the exquisite murals in the summer palace at Srirangaptna. It also incorporates the scientific investigation of the pigment composition of the paintings. Finally, the appendix has a survey of the coins of the Mysore Sultans from the National Museum collection. This book is based on extensive fieldwork and photo-documentation and an indepth study of contemporary Indian, Persian and English literary sources, paintings, illustrated imperial manuscripts and inscriptions. It is replete with over three hundred spectacular photographs, contemporary maps, topographic surveys and line drawings, highlighting all nuances of the subject. The attempt is to examine the art and architecture of the Mysore Sultans from every possible point of view and the book will surely be of immense value to scholars, students and art-lovers.

In the summer of 1995, six tourists were kidnapped in the mountains of Kashmir. The ransom note said the kidnappers were from an unheard of Islamic outfit and that they wanted the release of Pakistani militant leader Maulana Masood Azhar (later responsible for the attack on the Indian parliament). The kidnapping electrified the world and for the first time put the global spotlight on Kashmir. Within four days, one of the prisoners had made a hair-raising escape. A month on, was found, beheaded by his captors who had carved their name into his flesh. In the background, camped out in Delhi, the families of the missing struggled to keep their hopes alive, while international governments negotiated frantically with India, and the army, police and intelligence services tried to follow the trail.

"DONGRI TO DUBAI: SIX DECADES OF THE MUMBAI MAFIA (pb)","Dongri to Dubai is the first ever attempt to chronicle the history of the Mumbai mafia. It is the story of notorious gangsters like Haji Mastan, Karim Lala, Varadarajan Mudaliar, Chhota Rajan, Abu Salem, but above all, it is the story of a young man who went astray despite having a father in the police force. Dawood Ibrahim was initiated into crime as a pawn in the hands of the Mumbai police and went on to wipe out the competition and eventually became the Mumbai police s own nemesis.   The narrative encompasses several milestones in the history of crime in India, from the rise of the Pathans, formation of the Dawood gang, the first ever supari, mafia s nefarious role in Bollywood, Dawood s move to Karachi, and Pakistan s subsequent alleged role in sheltering one of the most wanted persons in the world.   This story is primarily about how a boy from Dongri became a don in Dubai, and captures his bravado, cunningness, focus, ambition, and lust for power in a gripping narrative. The meticulously researched book provides an in-depth and comprehensive account of the mafia s games of supremacy and internecine warfare.  Author: S. Hussain Zaidi S.

"PATRIOT'S HISTORY OF THE MODERN WORLD, A: FROM AMERICA'S EXCEPTIONAL ASCENT TO THE ATOMIC BOMB: 1898-1945 (hb)2012","Conservative historian Larry Schweikart has won wide acclaim for his #1 New York Times bestseller, A Patriot's History of the United States. It proved that, contrary to the liberal biases in countless other history books, America had not really been founded on racism, sexism, greed and oppression. Schweikart and co-author Michael Allen restored the truly great achievements of America's patriots, founders, and heroes to their rightful place of honor.   Now Schweikart and co-author Dave Dougherty are back with a new perspective on America's half-century rise to the center of the world stage. This all-new volume corrects many of the biases that cloud the way people view the Treaty of Versailles, the Roaring 20s, the crash of 1929, the deployment of the atomic bomb, and other critical events in global history.   No other country has shaped the modern world more than America, as a champion for innovation, equality, democracy, and freedom far disproportionate to its geographical size, its population, or even its military might. And contrary to the protestations of critics and enemies, the United States has, time and again, proved itself a force for good, far more often than not.   Beginning with the Spanish-American War—which introduced the U.S. as a global military power that could no longer be ignored—and continuing through the end of World War II, this book shows how a free, capitalist nation could thrive when put face-to-face with tyrannical and socialist powers. Schweikart and Dougherty narrate the many times when America proved its dominance by upholding the principles on which it was founded—and struggled on the rare occasions when it strayed from those principles.   The authors make a convincing case that America has constantly been a force for good in the world, improving standards of living, introducing new innovations, guaranteeing liberty, and offering opportunities to those who had none elsewhere. They also illustrate how the country ascended to superpower status at the same time it was figuring out its own identity. While American ideals were defeating tyrants abroad, a constant struggle against progressivism was being waged at home, leading to the stumbles of the Great Depression, the New Deal, and the attack on Pearl Harbor.   Despite this rocky entrance onto the world stage, it was during this half century that the world came to embrace all things American, from its innovations and businesses to its political systems and popular culture. The U. S. began to define what the rest of the world could emulate as the new global ideal.    A Patriot’s History of the Modern World provides a new perspective on our extraordinary past—and offers lessons we can apply to preserve American exceptionalism today and tomorrow.   AUTHOR:  Larry Schweikart is the coauthor of A Patriot’s History of the United States, which became a #1 New York Times bestseller and won the acclaim of major conservative figures such as Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh.   Dave Dougherty is a self-employed businessman who has collaborated with prominent historians on their books, most recently on Schweikart’s What Would the Founders Say?

"GOVERNING THE WORLD: THE HISTORY OF AN IDEA (hb)2012","The story of global cooperation between nations and peoples is a tale of dreamers goading us to find common cause in remedying humanity’s worst problems.  But international institutions have also provided a tool for the powers that be to advance their own interests and stamp their imprint on the world.  Mark Mazower’s Governing the World tells the epic story of that inevitable and irresolvable tension—the unstable and often surprising alchemy between ideas and power.  From the beginning, the willingness of national leaders to cooperate has been spurred by crisis: the book opens in 1815, amid the rubble of the Napoleonic Empire, as the Concert of Europe was assembled with an avowed mission to prevent any single power from dominating the continent and to stamp out revolutionary agitation before it could lead to war. But if the Concert was a response to Napoleon, internationalism was a response to the Concert, and as courts and monarchs disintegrated they were replaced by revolutionaries and bureaucrats.  19th century internationalists included bomb-throwing anarchists and the secret policemen who fought them, Marxist revolutionaries and respectable free marketeers. But they all embraced nationalism, the age’s most powerful transformative political creed, and assumed that nationalism and internationalism would go hand in hand. The wars of the twentieth century saw the birth of institutions that enshrined many of those ideals in durable structures of authority, most notably the League of Nations in World War I and the United Nations after World War II.   Throughout this history, we see that international institutions are only as strong as the great powers of the moment allow them to be. The League was intended to prop up the British empire. With Washington taking over world leadership from Whitehall, the United Nations became a useful extension of American power.  But as Mazower shows us, from the late 1960s on, America lost control over the dialogue and the rise of the independent Third World saw a marked shift away from the United Nations and toward more pliable tools such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.  From the 1990s to 2007, Governing the World centers on a new regime of global coordination built upon economic rule-making by central bankers and finance ministers, a regime in which the interests of citizens and workers are trumped by the iron logic of markets.  Now, the era of Western dominance of international life is fast coming to an end and a new multi-centered global balance of forces is emerging. We are living in a time of extreme confusion about the purpose and durability of our international institutions.  History is not prophecy, but Mark Mazower shows us why the current dialectic between ideals and power politics in the international arena is just another stage in an epic two-hundred-year story.

"AMRITSAR MASSACRE: THE UNTOLD STORY OF ONE FATEFUL DAY (hb)2012","At approximately 5:10 pm on 13 April 1919, Brigadier – General ‘Rx’ Dyer led a small party of soldiers through the centre of Amritsar into a walled garden known as the Jallianwala Bagh. He had been informed that an illegal political meeting was taking place and had come to disperse it. Dyer’s men entered the garden and immediately opened fire upon the huge crowd that had gathered there. 379 people were killed and at least 1,000 more were wounded in what has became known as the Amritsar Massacre.  The massacre is the most infamous atrocity in the history of British rule in India. Opening fire on an unarmed gathering of people, it was the most brutal incident of its kind, fatally weakening the British position in India and uniting the people of the subcontinent against their colonial masters. It is commonly seen as the turning point in India’s struggle for freedom, an episode that has become enshrined in Indian national myth and which is still recounted to generations of school children as a moment of inexplicable imperial barbarity.  This important new book aims to dispel the myths and misconceptions surrounding the massacre. It challenges the conventional historiography by offering a defence of the British Raj through a more balanced account of events and the decisions that were taken in 1919. Nick L Lloyd begins his retelling with Britain’s hopes for as new age of collaboration and reform in1917 and 1918 and then explains the growth of nationalist discontent, before taking the reader into the claustrophobic streets of the Punjab in April 1919 when violence broke out. Part historical account of a boldly massacre, part history of an empire in a period of great change, The Amritsar Massacre will appeal to both history enthusiasts and the general reader.  About the Author: Nick Lloyd is Lecturer in Defence Studies at King’s College London, based at the Joint Services Command and Staff college in Shrivenham, Wiltshire.

"VANISHED KINGDOMS: THE RISE AND FALL OF STATES AND NATIONS (hb)2012","An evocative account of fourteen European kingdoms-their rise, maturity, and eventual disappearance.   There is something profoundly romantic about lost civilizations. Europe's past is littered with states and kingdoms, large and small, that are scarcely remembered today, and while their names may be unfamiliar-Aragon, Etruria, the Kingdom of the Two Burgundies-their stories should change our mental map of the past. We come across forgotten characters and famous ones-King Arthur and Macbeth, Napoleon and Queen Victoria, right up to Stalin and Gorbachev-and discover how faulty memory can be, and how much we can glean from these lost empires. Davies peers through the cracks in the mainstream accounts of modern-day states to dazzle us with extraordinary stories of barely remembered pasts, and of the traces they left behind.  This is Norman Davies at his best: sweeping narrative history packed with unexpected insights. Vanished Kingdoms will appeal to all fans of unconventional and thought-provoking history, from readers of Niall Ferguson to Jared Diamond.  About the Author Norman Davies is a supernumerary Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, Fellow of the British Academy and of the Royal Historical Society, and Professor Emeritus at London University.

"GANDHI IN THE WEST: THE MAHATMA AND THE RISE OF RADICAL PROTEST (hb)2012","The non-violent protests of civil rights activists and anti-nuclear campaigners during the 1960s helped to redefine Western politics. But where did they come from? Sean Scalmer uncovers their history in an earlier generation's intense struggles to understand and emulate the activities of Mahatma Gandhi. He shows how Gandhi's non-violent protests were the subject of widespread discussion and debate in the USA and UK for several decades. Though at first misrepresented by Western newspapers, they were patiently described and clarified by a devoted group of cosmopolitan advocates. Small groups of Westerners experimented with Gandhian techniques in virtual anonymity and then, on the cusp of the 1960s, brought these methods to a wider audience. The swelling protests of later years increasingly abandoned the spirit of non-violence, and the central significance of Gandhi and his supporters has therefore been forgotten. This book recovers this tradition, charts its transformation, and ponders its abiding significance.

"BOMBAY ISLAM: THE RELIGIOUS ECONOMY OF THE WEST INDIAN OCEAN, 1840-1915 (hb)2012","As a thriving port city, nineteenth-century Bombay attracted migrants from across India and beyond. Nile Green's Bombay Islam traces the ties between industrialization, imperialism and the production of religion to show how Muslim migration fueled demand for a wide range of religious suppliers, as Christian missionaries competed with Muslim religious entrepreneurs for a stake in the new market. Enabled by a colonial policy of non-intervention in religious affairs, and powered by steam travel and vernacular printing, Bombay's Islamic productions were exported as far as South Africa and Iran. Connecting histories of religion, labour and globalization, the book examines the role of ordinary people – mill hands and merchants – in shaping the demand that drove the market. By drawing on hagiographies, travelogues, doctrinal works, and poems in Persian, Urdu and Arabic, Bombay Islam unravels a vernacular modernity that saw people from across the Indian Ocean drawn into Bombay's industrial economy of enchantment.

"GREAT PARTITION: THE MAKING OF INDIA AND PAKISTAN, THE (pb) 2013","The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan. The definitive book on the impact of the Partition on everyday lives. Winner of the Gladstone Prize from the Royal Historical Society. A brilliantly written and widely acclaimed work of scholarship. Seamlessly combines intelligent analysis with heartrending human stories. The Partition of India in 1947 was one of the most horrific events of decolonization in the twentieth century, bringing death, rape and plunder in its wake.

"GOVERNING THE WORLD: THE HISTORY OF AN IDEA, 1815 TO THE PRESENT(pb)2013","A majestic narrative reckoning with the forces that have shaped the nature and destiny of the world’s governing institutions  The story of global cooperation is a tale of dreamers goading us to find common cause in remedying humanity’s worst problems. But international institutions are also tools for the powers that be to advance their own interests. Mark Mazower’s Governing the World tells the epic, two-hundred-year story of that inevitable tension—the unstable and often surprising alchemy between ideas and power. From the rubble of the Napoleonic empire in the nineteenth century through the birth of the League of Nations and the United Nations in the twentieth century to the dominance of global finance at the turn of the millennium, Mazower masterfully explores the current era of international life as Western dominance wanes and a new global balance of powers emerges.

"ANCESTRAL JOURNEYS","Who are the Europeans and where did they come from? In recent years scientific advances have released a mass of data, turning cherished ideas upside down. The idea of migration in prehistory, so long out of favor, is back on the agenda. New advances allow us to track human movement and the spread of crops, animals, and disease, and we can see the evidence of population crashes and rises, both continent-wide and locally. Visions of continuity have been replaced with a more dynamic view of Europe’s past, with one wave of migration followed by another, from the first human arrivals in Europe to the Vikings.   Ancient DNA links Europe to its nearest neighbors. It is not a new idea that farming was brought from the Near East, but genetics now reveal an unexpectedly complex process in which farmers arrived not in one wave, but several. Even more unexpected is the evidence that the European gene pool was stirred vigorously many times after farming had reached most of Europe. Climate change played a part in this upheaval, but so did new inventions such as the plough and wheeled vehicles. Genetic and linguistic clues also enhance our understanding of the upheavals of the Migration Period, the wanderings of steppe nomads, and the adventures of the Vikings.   124 illustrations, including 59 maps   Author: Jean Manco has taught at Plymouth and Bristol universities.

"THE MAKING OF THE MIDDLE SEA (hb) 2013","The Mediterranean has been for millennia one of the global cockpits of human endeavour. World-class interpretations exist of its Classical and subsequent history, but there has been remarkably little holistic exploration of how its societies, culture and economies first came into being, despite the fact that almost all the fundamental developments originated well before 500 bc. This book is the first full, interpretive synthesis for a generation on the rise of the Mediterranean world from its beginning, before the emergence of our own species, up to the threshold of Classical times. Extensively illustrated and ranging across disciplines, subject matter and chronology from early humans and the origins of farming and metallurgy to the rise of civilizations Egyptian, Levantine, Hispanic, Minoan, Mycenaean, Phoenician, Etruscan, early Greek the book is a masterpiece of archaeological and historical writing.

"FREEDOM AT MIDNIGHT-REVISED (NEW COVER)","First published in 1975, this 2009 edition is a new edition of the best-selling book described as irreplaceable by Le Monde, Paris. It is a poignant reminder of the defining moments of the end of the British Raj, the independence of 400 million people, their division into India and the newly created Pakistan. Time Magazine raised a poetic salutation to this brilliantly written book, hailing it as the Song of India . . . illuminated like scenes in a pageant .    The significance of the new edition lies in engaging the minds of two generations born into a free country, to enable them to empathetically understand the aspirations and goals that united our leaders then towards the common cause of freedom. The significance lies in invoking the re-awakening of the Indian spirit. Surely it is time for the over 1 billion people in India to ask themselves honestly what their contribution has been thus far towards realizing an India free from poverty, illiteracy and inequality.    While numerous tomes have been written on the Indian freedom struggle, the popularity of Freedom at Midnight lies in its easy narrative flow which veers from the thrilling to the enlightening, sometimes poignant and ever-compelling style.

"A PELICAN INTRODUCTION: REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA, 1891-1991 (pb) 2014","What caused the Russian Revolution? Did it succeed or fail? Why are we still all living with its consequences?  In his remarkable new book Orlando Figes describes and takes apart the story of Russia's century of revolution in the shortest space possible. Starting with the horrific famines of 1891, Figes charts a vast experiment in state-building. The manipulation of many millions of people, first by Tsarist ministers and then by the Communists - on a scale and with a ferocity that their predecessors could not dream of - aimed to totally transform Russian society. Through war and peace Russia's rulers battled to subdue and control their vast state, fighting off a mass of real and imagined enemies until exhaustion, corruption and intellectual bankruptcy brought the whole terrible experiment to an end.   As the Soviet Union becomes ever more distant in our memory, Revolutionary Russia is an invaluable reminder of why this one, hideously violent and callous state became for so long the great focus of the hopes and fears of much of humankind.

"CURSED VICTORY: A HISTORY OF ISRAEL AND THE OCCUPIED TERRITORIES (hb)2014","In a move that would forever alter the map of the Middle East, Israel captured the West Bank, Golan Heights, Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula in 1967's brief but pivotal Six Day War. Cursed victory is the first complete history of the war's troubled aftermath - a military occupation of the Palestinian territories that is now well into its fifth decade. Drawing on unprecedented access high-level sources, top-secret memos and never-before-published letters, the book provides a gripping and unvarnished chronicle of how what Israel promised would be an 'enlightened occupation' quickly turned sour, and the anguished diplomatic attempts to bring it to an end. Bregman sheds fresh light on critical moments in the peace process, taking us behind the scenes as decisions about the fate of the territories were made, and more often, as crucial opportunities to resolve the conflict were missed. As the narrative moves from Jerusalem to New York, Oslo to Beirut, and from the late 1960s to the present day, Cursed victory provides vivid portraits of the key players in this unfolding drama, including Moshe Dayan, King Hussein of Jordan, Bill Clinton and Yasser Arafat. Yet Bregman always reminds us how diplomatic and back-room negotiations affected the daily lives of millions of Arabs, and how the Palestinian resistance, especially during the first and second intifadas, in turn shaped political developments. As Bregman concludes, the occupation has become a dark stain on Israel's history, and an era when international opinion of the country shifted decisively. Cursed victory is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the origins of the ongoing conflict in the region.

"THE AGE OF WRATH: A HISTORY OF THE DELHI SULTANAT (hb)2014","The Delhi Sultanate period (1206 1526) is commonly portrayed as an age of chaos and violence of rapacious, plundering kings, turbulent dynasties, and the aggressive imposition of Islam on India. But it was also the era that saw the creation of a pan-Indian empire, on the foundations of which the Mughals and the British later built their own Indian empires. The encounter between Islam and Hinduism also transformed, among other things, India s architecture, literature, music and food. Abraham Eraly brings this fascinating period vividly alive, portraying the many kings mad, brilliant, astute, cruel who ruled during this period, and discussing the political, social and cultural developments that transformed India. Combining erudition with powerful storytelling, analysis with anecdote, The Age of Wrath is a superb book.  Author: Abraham Eraly is the acclaimed author of three books on Indian history The Last Spring: The Lives and Times of The Great Mughals (later published in two volumes as Emperors of the Peacock Throne and The Mughal World), Gem in the Lotus: The Seeding of Indian Civilisation and The First Spring: The Golden Age of India.

"BAYMISAL HUKMARAN TIPU SULTAN (hb)","Tipu Sultan was a good administrator as well as a good warrior. He had inflicted serious damages and casualties on the British in the First and Second Mysore Wars and had shattered the myth of their invincibility. He laid the foundation of a dam across the river Cauvery, where the Indians later built the Krishna Raja Sagora Dam. He also had the beautiful Lal Bagh built, together with roads, public buildings and ports along the shores of Kerala. Traders from Mysore were dealing with countries as far away as Iran and Turkey. Tipu and his father are credited with the innovation of war rockets, which were later copied and improved upon by the British. He had also started minting coins in a sort of banking system, devised a new calendar and a system of weights and measures.   Some British and Indian historians have distorted history to suit their own purposes. They portrayed Tipu Sultan as a fanatical Muslim who prosecuted Hindus and Christians. Nothing is further from the truth. Tipu Sultan was a moderate and tolerant ruler. He was credited with building the first church in Mysore at the request of the French. In 1791 some Maratha horsemen under Ragunath Rao raided the temple of Siringeri, killing and wounding many and robbing the temple of all its valuables. The high priest of the temple sent a petition to Tipu Sultan. The Mysore Archives Department has 30 letters of this correspondence. Tipu Sultan was furious at the plunder of the temple and remarked: “People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date... People do evil deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying.” Tipu Sultan immediately ordered a substantial amount and some valuable gifts to be given to the high priest and aid continued to the temple until the death of Tipu Sultan.

"JERUSALEM: A JOURNEY BACK IN TIME","This book is a journey through the history of Jerusalem. The entire city is a veritable museum-a treasure trove of all things sacred to the Jews, the Christians and the Muslims. Every stone here has witnessed the tumultuous history of the three faiths and their faithful. The journey begins with the migration of Prophet Abraham to Canaan and ends with the fall of Palestine in 1967. It evokes the interminable suffering of the Jews and the cruelty of the Christian Crusaders who drowned the streets of the Holy City in the blood of Muslims and Jews. This is the story of Bait al Maqdis where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) attained Mairaj, and where Caliph Umar proclaimed Islam. The saga of Jerusalem flows with the history of the Ummayads, the Abbasids, the Fatimids, the Ayyubids, the Mamluks and the Ottomans. The splendid Islamic architecture is embodied in the magnificent Dome of the Rock, which stands proud as the icon of Muslim heritage in a world beset with violence and hatred.

"VANISHING KARACHI (hb) 2015","Imperishable Images of a Vanishing Karachi. Every photograph expresses two elements in equal measure -- the image of the subject being photographed as much as the thoughts and feeling of the person taking the photograph.  .M.Shahid has captured indelible images of Karachi's pre-1947 architectural heritage, a not- very-cast inheritance which is swiftly being battered and bull-dozed into plastic super-markets and multi-storeyed apartment blocks.  The pictures are not simply sentimental mementos. A few images spring out to hit us right in the soft stomach of our conscience - they show beautiful building in the process of being blasted. Some images reveal the painstaking care for detail that went into their design and also reveal the thoughtless haste that now goes into their outright destruction or gradual erosion by willful neglect.  These imperishable images of a vanishing Karachi represent a fine example of photography used to perform an authentic public service. Such pictures of conscience reflect the breadth and depth of Shahid's concern for his environment. They are also a remarkable exposition of his versatility. His talent as a singer and a writer of humor and satire is already well-known. ","PKR 1,595.00","S. M.

"AN ERA OF DARKNESS: THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN INDIA (hb) 2016","In 1930, the American historian and philosopher Will Durant wrote that Britain s conscious and deliberate bleeding of India... [was the] greatest crime in all history . He was not the only one to denounce the rapacity and cruelty of British rule, and his assessment was not exaggerated. Almost thirty-five million Indians died because of acts of commission and omission by the British in famines, epidemics, communal riots and wholesale slaughter like the reprisal killings after the 1857 War of Independence and the Amritsar massacre of 1919. Besides the deaths of Indians, British rule impoverished India in a manner that beggars belief. When the East India Company took control of the country, in the chaos that ensued after the collapse of the Mughal empire, India s share of world GDP was 23 per cent. When the British left it was just above 3 per cent. The British empire in India began with the East India Company, incorporated in 1600, by royal charter of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I, to trade in silk, spices and other profitable Indian commodities. Within a century and a half, the Company had become a power to reckon with in India. In 1757, under the command of Robert Clive, Company forces defeated the ruling Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal at Plassey, through a combination of superior artillery and even more superior chicanery. A few years later, the young and weakened Mughal emperor, Shah Alam II, was browbeaten into issuing an edict that replaced his own revenue officials with the Company s representatives. Over the next several decades, the East India Company, backed by the British government, extended its control over most of India, ruling with a combination of extortion, double-dealing, and outright corruption backed by violence and superior force. This state of affairs continued until 1857, when large numbers of the Company s Indian soldiers spearheaded the first major rebellion against colonial rule. After the rebels were defeated, the British Crown took over power and ruled the country ostensibly more benignly until 1947, when India won independence. In this explosive book, bestselling author Shashi Tharoor reveals with acuity, impeccable research, and trademark wit, just how disastrous British rule was for India. Besides examining the many ways in which the colonizers exploited India, ranging from the drain of national resources to Britain, the destruction of the Indian textile, steel-making and shipping industries, and the negative transformation of agriculture, he demolishes the arguments of Western and Indian apologists for Empire on the supposed benefits of British rule, including democracy and political freedom, the rule of law, and the railways. The few unarguable benefits the English language, tea, and cricket were never actually intended for the benefit of the colonized but introduced to serve the interests of the colonizers. Brilliantly narrated and passionately argued, An Era of Darkness will serve to correct many misconceptions about one of the most contested periods of Indian history.  Author: Shashi Tharoor  Shashi Tharoor is the bestselling author of fifteen previous books, both fiction and non-fiction, besides being a noted critic and columnist. His books include the path-breaking satire The Great Indian Novel (1989), the classic India: From Midnight to the Millennium (1997), and most recently, India Shastra: Reflections on the Nation in Our Time (2015). He was a former Under Secretary-General of the United Nations and a former Minister of State for Human Resource Development and Minister of State for External Affairs in the Government of India. He is a two-time member of the Lok Sabha from Thiruvananthapuram and chairs Parliament s External Affairs Committee. He has won numerous literary awards, including a Commonwealth Writers Prize, and was honoured as New Age Politician of the Year (2010) by NDTV.

"KARL MARX: GREATNESS AND ILLUSION (hb) 2016","As the nineteenth century unfolded, its inhabitants had to come to terms with an unparalleled range of political, economic, religious and intellectual challenges. Distances shrank, new towns sprang up, and ingenious inventions transformed the industrial landscape. It was an era dominated by new ideas about God, human capacities, industry, revolution, empires and political systems - and above all, the shape of the future. One of the most distinctive and arresting contributions to this debate was made by Karl Marx, the son of a Jewish convert in the Rhineland and a man whose entire life was devoted to making sense of the hopes and fears of the nineteenth century world. Gareth Stedman Jones's impressive biography explores how Marx came to his revolutionary ideas in an age of intellectual ferment, and the impact they had on his times. In a world where so many things were changing so fast, would the coming age belong to those enthralled by the events which had brought this world into being, or to those who feared and loathed it? This remarkable book allows the reader to understand as never before the world of ideas which shaped Marx's world - and in turn made Marx shape our own.

"BURMA'44: THE BATTLE THAT TURNED BRITAIN'S WAR IN THE EAST","In February 1944, a rag-tag collection of clerks, drivers, doctors, muleteers, and other base troops, stiffened by a few dogged Yorkshiremen and a handful of tank crews managed to hold out against some of the finest infantry in the Japanese Army, and then defeat them in what was one of the most astonishing battles of the Second World War.  What became know as The Defence of the Admin Box, fought amongst the paddy fields and jungle of Northern Arakan over a fifteen-day period, turned the battle for Burma. Not only was it the first decisive victory for British troops against the Japanese, more significantly, it demonstrated how the Japanese could be defeated. The lessons learned in this tiny and otherwise insignificant corner of the Far East, set up the campaign in Burma that would follow, as General Slim's Fourteenth Army finally turned defeat into victory.  Burma '44 is a tale of incredible drama. As gripping as the story of Rorke's drift, as momentous as the battle for the Ardennes, the Admin Box was a triumph of human grit and heroism and remains one of the most significant yet undervalued conflicts of World War Two.

India produced the largest volunteer army in world history: over 2 million men. But, until now, there has never been a comprehensive account of India's turbulent home front and the nexus between warfare and India’s society. In The Raj at War we hear the myriad voices of ordinary Indian people, from the first Indian to win the Victoria Cross to the three soldiers imprisoned as ‘traitors to the Raj’ who returned to a hero’s welcome, from the nurses in Indian General Hospitals to labourers and their families in remote villages.   Yasmin Khan presents the overlooked history of India at war, and shows how mobilisation for the war unleashed seismic processes of economic, cultural and social change – decisively shaping the international war effort, the unravelling of the empire and India’s own political trajectory.

"THE PAKISTAN PARADOX: INSTABILITY AND RESILIENCE (pb)","The idea of Pakistan stands riddled with tensions. Initiated by a small group of select Urdu-speaking Muslims who envisioned a unified Islamic state, today Pakistan suffers the divisive forces of various separatist movements and religious fundamentalism. A small entrenched elite continue to dominate the country’s corridors of power, and democratic forces and legal institutions remain weak. But despite these seemingly insurmountable problems, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan continues to endure. The Pakistan Paradox is the definitive history of democracy in Pakistan, and its survival despite ethnic strife, Islamism and deep- seated elitism. This edition focuses on three kinds of tensions that are as old as Pakistan itself. The tension between the unitary definition of the nation inherited from Jinnah and centrifugal ethnic forces; between civilians and army officers who are not always in favour of or against democracy; and between the Islamists and those who define Islam only as a cultural identity marker.

"ADNAN'S STORY: THE CASE THAT INSPIRED THE PODCAST PHENOMENON SERIAL (pb)2016","'The first letter I received after being arrested in 1999 was from Rabia. Since that time until now, she has believed in my innocence and been committed to my exoneration. . . . [T]here is no one better to help tell my story, and no one that I trust more to tell it, than Rabia.' Adnan Syed  On February 28, 2000, Adnan Syed was convicted and sentenced to life plus thirty years for the murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, a high school senior in Baltimore, Maryland. From the moment of his arrest, Syed has consistently maintained his innocence. Rabia Chaudry, a family friend, always believed him and has never given up the hope that he might someday be released. By 2013, however, after almost all appeals had been exhausted, things looked bleak. That's when Rabia contacted Sarah Koenig, a producer at This American Life, in the hopes of finding a journalist who would bring greater attention to Adnan's story and might shed new light on the case. Koenig's investigation turned into Serial, an international phenomenon and Peabody Award-winning podcast.  Adnan's Story will reexamine the investigation that led to Adnan Syed’s arrest, share his life in prison, cover new evidence and possibilities that have since come to light, and review the recent court successes - including a ruling by a Maryland judge to reopen Syed’s case. Woven with personal reflections from Adnan himself, including new never-before-seen letters he penned from prison, the story of his family, community, and public advocate Chaudry, the book offers new insight into the story that captivated the attention of millions as his legal team and investigatory team, along with countless others who have crowd-sourced an investigation like never before, seek to exonerate him and find out the truth of what really happened on that day in 1999.   What has captivated the public about Adnan's story are the layers of contradictions, fascinating characters, cultural dissonance, and fog of ambiguity around what really happened to Hae Min Lee. But this is not just a personal story, it is a testament to a thoroughly broken system that convicts tens of thousands of innocent people, and how the power of the media and public can move rigid institutions to bring about justice.","PKR 2,702.00","RABIA CHAUDRY",9781780894881,2016,"GENERAL INTEREST > HISTORY",1,Paperback,English,416,images/books/9781780894881.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781780894881&opt=3&sUBcAT=05

"LAHORE IN THE TIME OF THE RAJ (hb) 2016","Lahore during the Raj was a prosperous and cosmopolitan place, where many communities lived together and there was a constant flow of goods, people and ideas. In the Mughal era, the city’s strategic location at the junction of roads to Kabul, Multan, Kashmir and Delhi made it a seat of power and poets, artists and traders flocked there for patronage from the royal court. The city expanded under the Sikhs as well and with the annexation of Punjab by the British, Lahore entered a new phase.   Lahore’s fabled Raj-era buildings—including the GPO, the High Court and the Museum—are widely acclaimed examples of colonial architecture. The British lived in Civil Lines, the Cantonment and the Mall; while in the 1920s, the prestigious Indian suburb of Model Town came up which, with its well-ordered streets, parks and bungalows, became a template for all subsequent residential colonies in the subcontinent.   The 1930s and 1940s were a time of intense cultural and political creativity and writers and artists flourished; F.C. College and Government College were celebrated centers of learning and there was great engagement between Lahore and the nascent Bollywood film industry, which the traumas of Partition ended.   Memories of that glittering city still linger on both sides of the border.  Author: Ian Talbot, Tahir Kamran   Ian Talbot is professor of modern British history and formerly head of history at the University of Southampton.

"REMNANTS OF A SEPARATION: A HISTORY OF THE PARTITION THROUGH MATERIAL MEMORY (hb)","Remnants of a Separation is a unique attempt to revisit the Partition through objects that refugees carried with them across the border. These belongings absorbed the memory of a time and place, remaining latent and undisturbed for generations. They now speak of their owner’s pasts as they emerge as testaments to the struggle, sacrifice, pain and belonging at an unparalleled moment in history. A string of pearls gifted by a maharaja, carried from Dalhousie to Lahore, reveals the grandeur of a life that once was. A notebook of poems, brought from Lahore to Kalyan, shows one woman’s determination to pursue the written word despite the turmoil around her. A refugee certificate created in Calcutta evokes in a daughter the feelings of displacement her father had experienced upon leaving Mymensingh zila, now in Bangladesh. Written as a crossover between history and anthropology, Remnants of a Separation is the product of years of passionate research. It is an alternative history of the Partition – the first and only one told through material memory that makes the event tangible even seven decades later.

"WHITE MUGHALS: LOVE AND BETRAYAL IN EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY INDIA (pb)","White Mughals is the romantic and ultimately tragic tale of a passionate love affair that crossed and transcended all the cultural, religious and political boundaries of its time.  James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa—’Most excellent among Women’—the great-niece of the Nizam’s Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her—not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company.  It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the ‘white Mughals’ who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as ‘Hindoo Stuart’, who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick’s counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant.  In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years’ writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple’s reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.  Author: William Dalrymple FRSL, FRGS, FRAS (born William Hamilton-Dalrymple on 20 March 1965) is a Scottish historian and writer, art historian and curator, as well as a prominent broadcaster and critic.  His books have won numerous awards and prizes, including the Duff Cooper Memorial Prize, the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award, the Sunday Times Young British Writer of the Year Award, the Hemingway, the Kapuscinski and the Wolfson Prizes.

"JASMINE AND JOURNEYS: THE LIFE QUEST OF A SOUTH ASIAN WOMAN (hb)","“History, poetry, and autobiography merge in this beautifully written and moving account that takes us on a journey   from South Asia to Canada, from Mohammed bin Qasim to Justin Trudeau. It is a simple but powerfully written saga of a family struggling with the great issues of our times — diaspora, migration and prejudice — characterized by joy, heartbreak, hope and courage. The book carries the waft of the jasmine flower and is a gift that every reader should cherish.” Professor Akbar Ahmed Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies,  American University, Washington, DC  “Jasmine and Journeys by Najma Shamsi is a literary gem of a book and an enlightening read. What seemed to begin as an historical testimony for her children and grandchildren, ended up as a fascinating cultural and political history of the Indian sub-continent of South Asia. The story of Najma’s family is interwoven with the political history and culture of the times.  “The bonus for me, as I read deeper into the book, was discovering how little I really knew about the sub continent’s history and culture — the celebrations, the ceremonies, the rituals — as well as the social and political upheavals from ancient times through the British era, through partition of the sub-continent to the Pakistan of today, and from there on to frigid, but welcoming Canada. My knowledge of these challenging as well as fascinating times in the life of a people had been limited to the raw outlines painted in today’s hysterical media — in other words, virtual ignorance. Now, I feel as if I have a slightly better appreciation of how we got to where we are today, and a deeper understanding of events which have played a role in shaping our present world.

"DASTAN-E-GHADAR: THE TALE OF THE MUTINY (hb)","Zahir Dehlvi, an accomplished poet and young official in the court of Bahadur Shah Zafar, lived through the cataclysmic 1857 Revolt that changed the course of history, markingthe end of Mughal dominion and the instatement of the British Raj.  Dehlvi's memoir, written on his deathbed, not only chronicles the fading glory of the Mughal court and his entry into a vanishing way of life, but also, most importantly, pivots on the horrifying spectacle of the Revolt and its aftermath-from the violent siege of Shahjahanabad to the bloody reprisals that followed. We learn about the brutal murder of the British Resident and the ensuing deaths of the European men, women and children who were sheltering inside the Qila. We also glimpse the emperor's pleas to the rebels and his helplessness as they took over the Qila. Moreover, Dehlvi crucially elaborates on the plight of those who managed to escape the slaughter and carnage. Translated into English for the first time, Dehlvi's memoir is intensely vivid and moving, filled with incident and rich in insight. An immensely significant historical record of the Revolt as it unfolded, Dastan-e-Ghadar is also a compelling personal account that conjures the dramatically changing world Dehlvi lived in.  Author: Zahir Dehlvi  Zahir Dehlvi (1835-1911) was an official in the Mughal court of Bahadur Shah Zafar and also an accomplished poet. He was witness to a crucial moment in history and his memoir remains the most richly detailed surviving account of the course of the 1857 Revolt and its bitter consequences. Forced to flee Delhi in the aftermath of the Revolt, his later life was full of tribulation. He eventually settled in Hyderabad where he died.

The authors have produced a tremendous piece of documentation which is destined to become a classic. SK Rahmat Ali, Newsline, October 1996 Karachi’s best-known architect and conservationist Yasmeen Lari, together with Mihail Lari, has confirmed her good reputation by writing a high-quality historical and architectural history of the city of Karachi.

"MERI MITTI KAY LOG (hb)","Suhail Zaheer Lari’s portfolio of photographs stands testimony to the endeavour of the people of this country to survive against many odds, managing to celebrate life despite the shadow of death which stalks those who live on the edge of a world marked and often scarred by so many conflicts. A pictorial memoir, an imagined landscape, and a visual history: all of these describe the rich collection of images which bring Pakistan into our blunted conscience. It is imperative that Lari’s work be preserved, shared, and celebrated as much as he has celebrated the lives of his timeless subjects. Feryal Ali Gauhar Amazing portraits of aged men and women depict what nature paints with the brush of time on human faces. On the one hand one sees webs of wrinkles on seasoned faces and on the other, an untouched innocence on the young. Living in the mega city of Karachi, Suhail forms a relationship with them through the soil he owns as a Pakistani. He portrays a true picture of what he sees in the rural surroundings as well as slums, which exist side by side with the posh habitats in the metropolis. Like his previous book on the political history of Sindh, his present work of photography also speaks for his hard work and patience in collecting relevant data. He compiles the data maintaining the flow of the story. The outcome is like an elaborate spread of patchwork in sober tones with continuity of design. Shamim Akhter When one sees Suhail Lari’s collection of photographs inspired by Mother Earth, one realizes that photography is an art form. The black-and-white photographs taken at high speed, and with a high-speed film, have a grainy, textured effect so that human faces too, look as if they are at one with the natural environment. They send shivers down the spine, as they remind one of one’s genesis and the fact that we are, after all, just humble beings made of clay. The touches of colour projected by the photographs taken at high speed, lend them a look of a sketch rather than a snapshot. Truly an amazing work of art and craft!

An enthralling exploration of the most audacious and underhanded deceptions in the history of mankind, from sacred relics to financial schemes to fake art, music, and identities.  World history is littered with tall tales and those who have fallen for them. Ian Tattersall, a curator emeritus at the American Museum of Natural History, and Peter Névraumont, an award-winning book producer, have teamed up to create this anti-history of the world, in which Michelangelo fakes a cupid; the holy foreskin is venerated; arctic explorers search for an entrance into a hollow Earth; a woman is elected Pope; and people can survive on only air and sunshine.  Told chronologically, HOAX begins with the first documented announcement of the end of the world from 365 AD and winds its way through controversial tales such as the Loch Ness Monster and the Shroud of Turin, past proven fakes such as the Thomas Jefferson's ancient wine and the Davenport Tablets built by a lost race, and explores bald-faced lies in the art world, journalism, and archeology.

"THE CHAOS OF EMPIRE: THE BRITISH RAJ AND THE CONQUEST OF INDIA (pb)","A sweeping history of the conquest of India by the British, from the first faltering trading stations to the marbled imperial cities, emphasizing the violence of colonial rule and its chaotic inheritance.  The popular image of the British Raj-an era of efficient but officious governors, sycophantic local functionaries, doting amahs, blisteringly hot days and torrid nights-chronicled by Forster and Kipling is a glamorous, nostalgic, but entirely fictitious. In this dramatic revisionist history, Jon Wilson upends the carefully sanitized image of unity, order, and success to reveal an empire rooted far more in violence than in virtue, far more in chaos than in control.  Through the lives of administrators, soldiers, and subjects-both British and Indian-The Chaos of Empire traces Britain's imperial rule from the East India Company's first transactions in the 1600s to Indian Independence in 1947. The Raj was the most public demonstration of a state's ability to project power far from home, and its perceived success was used to justify interventions around the world in the years that followed. But the Raj's institutions-from law courts to railway lines-were designed to protect British power without benefiting the people they ruled. This self-serving and careless governance resulted in an impoverished people and a stifled society, not a glorious Indian empire.  Jon Wilson's new portrait of a much-mythologized era finally and convincingly proves that the story of benign British triumph was a carefully concocted fiction, here thoroughly and totally debunked.  Review “A virtuoso takedown of cherished shibboleths of Raj mythology.” —Financial Times  “Marvelous…The point of Wilson's argument is a good one. Nostalgia has obscured the truth, and the truth is essential to understanding some of the complexities of India today…A neat and modern telling that feels as necessary as a bucket of water in the face after a dizzying trip to the bazaar.” —The Times of London  “A healthy corrective…Wilson provides an unsparing account of the exploitation, expropriation and racism that were fundamental to the imperial project…it presents, with impressive erudition and substantial flair, a comprehensive picture of the colonial experience of a conquered people…a thoroughly-researched, persuasively narrated account of the British Raj.” —India Today  “Puncturing myths about the Raj…Wilson's bold claim is ably supported by deep research.” —Publishers Weekly, Starred Review  “An original and interesting work…Wilson understands the complexities of India.” —Literary Review  “For any young scholar or writer wanting to know how to make history-telling an enjoyable enterprise, Jon Wilson's [The Chaos of Empire] should be a must read.” —The Tribune [India] About the Author Jon Wilson was born in Leicester, England, educated at Oxford University and the New School for Social Research in New York, and has taught history at King's College London since 1999. He directs Historians in Residence, a project connecting history with public institutions in London.

In 1119, the people of the Near East came together in an epic clash of horses, swords, sand, and blood that would decide the fate of the city of the Aleppo-and the eastern Crusader states. Fought between tribal Turkish warriors on steppe ponies, Arab foot soldiers, Armenian bowmen, and European knights, the battlefield was the amphitheatre into which the people of Eurasia poured their full gladiatorial might. Carrying a piece of the true cross before them, the Frankish army advanced, anticipating a victory that would secure their dominance over the entire region. But the famed Frankish cavalry charge failed them, and the well-arranged battlefield dissolved into a melee. Surrounded by enemy forces, the crusaders suffered a colossal defeat. With their advance in Northern Syria stalled, the momentum of the crusader conquest began to evaporate, and would never be recovered.

With cardinals scattered across Europe and the next papal election uncertain, even if Catholicism survived, it seemed the papacy was finished.  In this gripping narrative of religious and political history, Paul Collins tells the improbable success story of the last 220 years of the papacy, from the unexalted death of Pope Pius VI in 1799 to the celebrity of Pope Francis today. In a strange contradiction, as the papacy has lost its physical power–its armies and states–and remained stubbornly opposed to the currents of social and scientific consensus, it has only increased its influence and political authority in the world.

"UN PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS IN SOMALIA 1992-1995 (hb)","UN Peacekeeping Operations in Somalia 1992-1995 A PAKISTANI PERSPECTIVE  UN Peacekeeping Operations in Somalia: A Pakistani Perspective is a seminal work highlighting the role of peacekeeping as an important tool of Pakistan’s foreign policy. This book is pathbreaking in that it examines for the first time, the issue of peacekeeping, from the prism of Pakistani national interests.  The book has been a labour of love. The author painstakingly researched the Somalia operations (1992-95) for over three years, interviewing politicians, diplomats and military commanders. He diligently accessed personal notes, photographs and regimental histories, archival records of newspapers and parliamentary debates and rare video clips of the peacekeeping operations to understand all angles of this operation. More than anything else, it is a tribute to the courage and professionalism of the unsung Pakistani soldiers operating in a foreign land.

I do not know whether to marry this rich widow whom my mother has introduced to me, or to marry this beautiful waitress I am in love with. To this his friend replied :You need to do two things. First, there is nothing like love.You should tonight only elope with the waitress.

"WINDOW STYLE 500 INSPIRATIONAL IDEAS FOR CURTAINS, BLINDS FABRICS (pb)2008","Windows form a focal point in most rooms. Walk into an empty room, and your eye is instantly drawn to the windows. Decisions about what window treatment to choose are often based on practical considerations: the function of the room in which they are situated, the architectural style or shape of the window, the style and colour of other furnishings within the room, the choice of materials available - and, of course, your budget. Window Style looks at some of these issues and shows that by carefully considering them, you can choose a style that will suit your window, your home and you. The book demonstrates the myriad styles available today by dividing them into eight distinct chapters: contemporary, classic, eclectic, romantic, rustic, retro, global and children's rooms. In each of these chapters there are detailed suggestions for adapting your preferred style to fit different shapes and styles of windows - so that, whatever the architectural style of your home, you will discover how to achieve your chosen look.
