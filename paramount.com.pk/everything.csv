MANAGING SPOILERS FOR SUSTAINABLE PEACE BETWEEN INDIA & PASKITAN (hb),"Basing on hypothesis that “Effective management of ideological and religious spoilers can lead to achievement of sustainable peace between India and Pakistan”, the book attempts to answer following questions:  What is the role of spoilers in a conflict? How can  different types of spoilers undermine a peace process?  What are the dictates of history about spoilers in  Indo-Pak peace process?  Why are ideological and religious spoilers de-tracking  Indo-Pak conflict?   What are their motives and drivers?  How can these ideological and religious spoilers be  managed for sustainable peace between both  countries?  AUTHOR  NOTE The research stems from intrinsic motivation based on personal experience of serving in conflict zone including Siachin (Line of Actual Contact), Kashmir (Line of Control) and Lahore (International Border). The curiosity to know reasons that led to deterioration of relations between India and Pakistan had always boggled my mind since long. The quest to understand phenomenon, during literature review from time to time, gave an insight to various factors including spoilers which were responsible for uncertain relations between both neighbours. However, most of literature covered the phenomenon theoretically and a number of questions remained unanswered. In this book, I have made an endeavour to highlight periods of ups and downs of relations graphically while co-relating the spoiling phenomenon with each “up and down” of relations. The periods of uncertainty has also been explained with reference to spoilers. Suggested way forward for both countries is expected to bring sustainability of peace in the region. Hopefully, the book will attract attention of concerned quarters.  ABOUT THE AUTHOR Lieutenant Colonel Imtiaz Hussain Naz joined Pakistan Army in 1999.

EMERGING DYNAMICS OF MANAGEMENT (hb) 2017,"I am extremely delighted that Sirajuddin Aziz has decided to publish the anthology of his articles in the form of a volume. This is a remarkable effort on his part as he is fully preoccupied with the onerous responsibilities of running a well managed commercial bank. But this does not come to me as a surprise. He is one of the few banking professionals who has always devoted time to reading, reflecting and writing, and using those insights and knowledge for articulating and disseminating fresh ways of thinking and doing things. I hope this volume is widely distributed as it is, in my view, a MUST reading not only for the business schools but also for those going through mid career and executive education training. Dr Ishrat Hussain, Ex-Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,  Former Dean, Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Advisor to the Wilson International Centre for Scholars   I find immense pleasure and a lot of enjoyment reading Sirajuddin Aziz’s invaluable publications, be it in leadership, communication, human resource, personal development areas, etc…, just to name a few. The articles set a clear road map toward success and reaching the pinnacle of excellence. The flawless way of writing complemented by a beautiful presentation of the issues and positions at work either in the boardroom or at the desk are, of great value and a perfect piece of advice. Abdulla Al-Mutawa Member of the Board, Bank Alfalah Limited, Abu Dhabi, UAE  A very seasoned banker, Sirajuddin Aziz is an honest and forthright person with an excellent understanding and grasp over his subject matter. His well-researched articles on ‘Management’ and other topics in local newspapers and magazines are a credible guide to good and ethical banking practices, they are a must read for bankers and non-bankers alike. A soft spoken self-effacing person. Those with such extensive experience, ‘hands on’ management have seldom been effective in translating that knowledge to either a public or a classroom audience as well as Siraj has done. He has that rare gift of being an effective communicator. As his colleague on the board of a major bank for over a dozen years, one was fortunate to get to see this honest and thoroughly professional corporate giant at first hand. His competence and integrity being something to cherish for me personally, Siraj is a true role model for our young generation. Ikram Sehgal, Chairman, Path Finders Group of Companies, Defence Analyst Sirajuddin Aziz is a versatile, insightful analyst of core management dimensions. A rare example of one who has achieved sustained success but who generously shares lessons from experience. In a professional field that coldly abstains from emotion and empathy, he emerges as a compassionate, sensitive human being. Self-critical and candid where relevant, supplemented by wide reading, he uses humour and gentle yet firm strength of reason to engage and to persuade. This anthology is a very sound balance sheet … plus profit aplenty. Ex-Senator (R) Javed Jabbar  “The way to change others mind is with affection and not anger” — Dalai Lama.  The manifestation of this concept is in the person of Sirajuddin Aziz as well as his writings on various topics. His style to change the mind is very persuasive in all what he writes and what he says. His articles have introduced new meanings and dimensions to subjects I thought I knew fairly well. Sirajuddin is honest with others and with himself. He is slow to see the faults of others but quick to discover their goodness. Syed Mazhar Abbas, Director, Bank Al Habib Limited In Pakistan’s corporate world there are scores of champion leaders and gurus, but hardly few of them share and transfer their experiences, management insights and career lessons in writing, let alone in the form of a book. Sirajuddin Aziz belongs to that minuscule minority, he writes on a diverse range of issues, particularly about personal development and various facets of management challenges and their solutions. The way he produces an article almost every week for various publications despite his busy schedule, underlines not just his passion for words but also a disciplined life-style. This collection of Mr Aziz is a first of its kind by a Pakistani author — is a treasure trove not just for the aspiring young professionals belonging to the corporate world, but also for the mid and senior-level leaders. Amir Zia, SEVP BOL News Group  Ex-Senior Editor, The NEWS International  Author: Sirajuddin Aziz is a professionally qualified and experienced banker who has worked for different organizations in Pakistan, China, Hong Kong, U.K., Nigeria and U.A.E. He is currently the President & Chief Executive Officer at Habib Metropolitan Bank. Prior to this, he has served as the chief executive officer of a leading commercial bank in Pakistan. He has been actively involved in overseeing the entire spectrum of banking operations of various banks for over thirty years. Mr Aziz is a Fellow of Institute of Bankers Pakistan (IBP).  He is the editor of the journal of IBP for about a decade.  He is also a member of Pakistan Institute of International Affairs. He is a regular speaker at prestigious education institutes, universities and professional forums, where he conducts sessions on a diverse range of subjects comprising credit, trade & foreign exchange, code of governance, economy, professional etiquettes and personal development. Mr Aziz also participates in televised discussions on finance & economy.  Mr Aziz is a regular contributor to national and international dailies, journals and magazines.

THE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE STORY (hb) 2017,"Britain was the birthplace of the steam locomotive and even today, the world speed record for steam remains with a British locomotive, Mallard. The steam locomotive went through several distinct phases during its long life, which came to an end on regular service in the late 1960s. There was the early phase, then the trend for large single driving wheels, compound locomotives with connected driving wheels once steel became strong enough for the connecting rods, tanks engines that could run equally well forwards and backwards, the 4-6-0 and 4-6-2 expresses, the passion for speed records and streamlining, and then the standardization years of British Railways. Steam locomotives were even incorporated into railcars to improve the economics of branch lines. So significant was the steam locomotive that it gave its name to an era, the Steam Age.

HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY (hb)2012,"Transparent in the visible range, phase objects can be studied in the optical range using holographic interferometry. Typically, the holograms are recorded on high-resolving-power holographic photo materials, but a lower spatial resolution is sufficient for successful research in many scientific applications. Holographic Interferometry: A Mach–Zehnder Approach offers practical guidance to research scientists and engineers using Mach–Zehnder holographic interferometry methods to study phase objects in the laboratory. The Mach–Zehnder approach allows the use of standard photographic film and electronic CCD/CMOS sensors with low resolving power, making it a simpler and more affordable option for testing many types of phase objects.  This book demonstrates how to use standard photographic film for the optical recording and reconstruction of Mach–Zehnder holograms. It also illustrates techniques for using CCD/CMOS cameras to digitally record Mach–Zehnder holograms/interferograms of transparent objects. Bringing together original research and information scattered throughout existing literature, this book focuses on the holographic reference beam and shearing interferometry methods. In particular, it looks at how these methods and optical schemes can be directly applied to testing aerodynamic flows, as well as to plasmas, shocks, and waves in noncoherent laser–matter interactions.   Numerous reconstructed and classic interferograms, deflectograms, and Schlierengrams illustrate the material, helping readers develop and design their own optimal optical scheme and choose applicable details to apply the approach. Describing methods in a mathematically simple and accessible way, this book is also suitable for graduate students in the fields of aerospace engineering and optics, as well as those in laser, thermal, and plasma physics.

CO-CLUSTEIRNG(pb)2013,"Cluster or co-cluster analyses are important tools in a variety of scientific areas. The introduction of this book presents a state of the art of already well-established, as well as more recent methods of co-clustering. The authors mainly deal with the two-mode partitioning under different approaches, but pay particular attention to a probabilistic approach. Chapter 1 concerns clustering in general and the model-based clustering in particular. The authors briefly review the classical clustering methods and focus on the mixture model. They present and discuss the use of different mixtures adapted to different types of data. The algorithms used are described and related works with different classical methods are presented and commented upon. This chapter is useful in tackling the problem of co-clustering under the mixture approach. Chapter 2 is devoted to the latent block model proposed in the mixture approach context. The authors discuss this model in detail and present its interest regarding co-clustering. Various algorithms are presented in a general context. Chapter 3 focuses on binary and categorical data. It presents, in detail, the appropriated latent block mixture models. Variants of these models and algorithms are presented and illustrated using examples. Chapter 4 focuses on contingency data. Mutual information, phi-squared and model-based co-clustering are studied. Models, algorithms and connections among different approaches are described and illustrated. Chapter 5 presents the case of continuous data. In the same way, the different approaches used in the previous chapters are extended to this situation.

COOPERATIVE CONTROL OF MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS THEORY AND APPLICATIONS (hb) 2017,"A comprehensive review of the state of the art in the control of multi-agent systems theory and applications  The superiority of multi-agent systems over single agents for the control of unmanned air, water and ground vehicles has been clearly demonstrated in a wide range of application areas. Their large-scale spatial distribution, robustness, high scalability and low cost enable multi-agent systems to achieve tasks that could not successfully be performed by even the most sophisticated single-agent systems.  Cooperative Control of Multi-Agent Systems: Theory and Applications provides a wide-ranging review of the latest developments in the cooperative control of multi-agent systems theory and applications. The applications described are mainly in the areas of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Throughout, the authors link basic theory to multi-agent cooperative control practice — illustrated within the context of highly-realistic scenarios of high-level missions — without losing site of the mathematical background needed to provide performance guarantees under general working conditions. Many of the problems and solutions considered involve combinations of both types of vehicles. Topics explored include target assignment, target tracking, consensus, stochastic game theory-based framework, event-triggered control, topology design and identification, coordination under uncertainty and coverage control.  Establishes a bridge between fundamental cooperative control theory and specific problems of interest in a wide range of applications areas Includes example applications from the fields of space exploration, radiation shielding, site clearance, tracking/classification, surveillance, search-and-rescue and more Features detailed presentations of specific algorithms and application frameworks with relevant commercial and military applications Provides a comprehensive look at the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field, while offering informed speculation on future directions for collective control systems  The use of multi-agent system technologies in both everyday commercial use and national defense is certain to increase tremendously in the years ahead, making this book a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and applied mathematicians working in systems and controls, as well as advanced undergraduates and graduate students interested in those areas.

BASICS OF ORGANIC FARMING (pb) 2017,"Organic farming is now recognized as the best known alternative to the conventional agriculture, where cultivation and raising of crops and best quality of food is grown without any harm to the soil health, environment and also to the human life itself. It helps in protecting the long-term fertility of soils by maintaining organic matter levels, encouraging soil biological activity and mechanical interventions. In organic agriculture the pests, weeds and diseases are managed primarily through crop rotations, natural predators, diversity, organic manuring, resistant varieties and limited thermal, biological and chemical interventions. India is now known to grow certified organic products which include basmati rice, pulses, honey, tea, spices, coffee, oilseeds, fruits, cereals, herbal medicines, cotton, garments, cosmetics,body care and other similar products.   This book aims to promote building of simple but workable technologies  in organic farming. The book should be of interest to agricultural, ecology and environmental populace; concerned educational institutions and universities; as well as organic growers,NGOs, trainers and different types of stakeholders and various organizations working in the field of organic agriculture. It is intended to be a unique and indispensable resource that offers a diverse range of value information, data and perspectives of the organic agricultural. Organic farming can provide quality food without adversely affecting the soil’s health and the environment; though raising a concern whether largescale organic farming will produce enough food for India’s large population.

"MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE WORLD: THYME, THE GENUS THYMUS (hb)","The genus Thymus consists of about 350 species of perennial, aromatic herbs and subshrubs native to Europe and North Africa. Various types of thyme are used all over the globe as condiments, ornamentals and sources of essential oil. Thyme oil (distilled from its leaves) is among the world's top ten essential oils, displaying antibacterial, antimycotic, antioxidative, food preservative and mammalian age-delaying properties. Because of the wide variety of its applications, the demand for thyme oil is growing; hence thyme commands an important place in an expanding world market. Commercial supply of thyme originates mainly from European countries, but recently this increased demand has lead to new winter-hardy, high yield cultivars being developed for commercial cultivation in Canada and North America.  This comprehensive volume covers all aspects of the biology, cultivation, pharmacology, chemistry and industrial processing of the genus Thymus. It is the most up to date overview of current knowledge in thyme use, and will be an invaluable reference source to those interested in medicinal plants, natural products, pharmacy, pharmacognosy and agronomy.

DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND A CRITICAL THEORY OF ENVIRONMENT (hb) 2005,"This book proposes an original critical theory of environmental sociology which is verified through actual projects relating to infrastructure development. The author locates each development project in its social, institutional and historical contexts, and explains their outcomes as the consequence of the actions of various individuals and groups, each acting rationally to optimise their own interests. The author argues that agencies regulating environmental impact should adopt a `reconstructive adaptive' strategy aimed at leaving the physical environment in a better condition than when the project began. Similarly, development projects should ensure that people affected by these projects, especially those whose livelihoods are linked to environmental resources, are at least as well off as they were without the project.

"NEW UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE BOOK 1, 2e (pb) 2003","This updated edition of a work on science for pupils in Year 7 in middle and secondary schools is designed to match the 1995 National Curriculum. This particular book is the first in a set of three which cover Key Stage 3 of the revised NC. Developed from a prior series of the same name, it retains the Core, Reinforcement and Extension structure. This provides a variety of routes through the text and allows differentiation for the less able, who may only do the core activities, and the more able, who begin with the Core but concentrate on the extension work. Regular Checkpoints enable the teacher to identify the correct route for each pupil. The course is based on a wide range of experimental and investigative activities. This edition reflects changes to the National Curriculum and allows clear progression from Key Stage 2 work. Investigative skills are taught at the beginning and are developed as investigations become more complex. Elementary concepts are revised before the knowledge and understanding needed for Key Stage 3 are introduced. The most recent research into pupils' understanding of science has been used to make concepts accessible to a wider range of pupils. The pages have been redesigned and the colour photographs, diagrams and cartoons have been updated.

NA PINJRAH NA AAHALNA (NA KAFAS NA ASHIYANA) (PUNJABI ED) (hb),"Having just passed his matriculation exams, he was leading a happy and carefree life with his family in Bahrain (Swat, Pakistan). Then suddenly his life took an unexpected turn when he was arrested on suspicion of murder, falsely accused and tortured by the police into signing a confession for a crime he did not commit, sentenced to death by the local magistrate, and thrown into the dark dungeons of the death cell to await execution. This is the real-life nightmare that young Sohail Fida had to endure at an age when most boys are worried about hairstyles and acne.   This harrowing ordeal might have crushed the spirits of an ordinary young man or may even have caused for him to rebel. However one thing that Sohail was not, was ordinary spirited. He dug deep down to find the strength and resilience from within to pursue his father’s dream of education and change all negative into positive. He passed his Intermediate exams, then his Bachelors and finally Masters in History, while being on death row.     His belief in his innocence and in the justice system was uncrushable. Surely enough after spending seven years on death row, his death sentence was commuted into life sentence. Sohail went on to do two more Masters in International Relations (for which he secured 7th position in Pakistan) and in English. Today he mentors in Haripur Central Prison in Hazara, where he awaits his release in 2012.     “The cells remain locked for twenty two hours of the day. They are opened twice for one hour, once in the morning and once in the evening to let the inmates have a walk. The inmates on death row are not allowed to go beyond the confines of the sector, and take the walk in the small ground with handcuffs tied on both hands. From then on I lost track of time and like the rest of the inmates, my life revolved around waiting for the time of our walk. The cell of a prisoner condemned to death is 12 ft (length) 8 ft (width). The front part, which is about 6 ½ ft long, forms the living area that the three of us shared. The back portion is divided into two parts; one part has a commode and bucket of water and serves as the toilet and the bathroom. The other part serves as a kitchen.     After we had spent a week in Haripur prison, my father came for a visit along with my mother. They sat on an old bed sheet across the three feet wide gate of the cell. Mother started crying and stopped only when my father told her not to make life more difficult for me. I could not bear seeing my mother sitting on the floor and wanted to tell her not to visit again, but did not have the heart to do so.”     Prisoner on the death row in Northern Pakistan who speaks his heart out through this absorbing and captivating autobiography Autobiography of a Pakistani Prisoner on the death row.

BAYMISAL HUKMARAN TIPU SULTAN (hb),"Tipu Sultan was a good administrator as well as a good warrior. He had inflicted serious damages and casualties on the British in the First and Second Mysore Wars and had shattered the myth of their invincibility. He laid the foundation of a dam across the river Cauvery, where the Indians later built the Krishna Raja Sagora Dam. He also had the beautiful Lal Bagh built, together with roads, public buildings and ports along the shores of Kerala. Traders from Mysore were dealing with countries as far away as Iran and Turkey. Tipu and his father are credited with the innovation of war rockets, which were later copied and improved upon by the British. He had also started minting coins in a sort of banking system, devised a new calendar and a system of weights and measures.   Some British and Indian historians have distorted history to suit their own purposes. They portrayed Tipu Sultan as a fanatical Muslim who prosecuted Hindus and Christians. Nothing is further from the truth. Tipu Sultan was a moderate and tolerant ruler. He was credited with building the first church in Mysore at the request of the French. In 1791 some Maratha horsemen under Ragunath Rao raided the temple of Siringeri, killing and wounding many and robbing the temple of all its valuables. The high priest of the temple sent a petition to Tipu Sultan. The Mysore Archives Department has 30 letters of this correspondence. Tipu Sultan was furious at the plunder of the temple and remarked: “People who have sinned against such a holy place are sure to suffer the consequences of their misdeeds at no distant date... People do evil deeds smilingly but suffer the consequences crying.” Tipu Sultan immediately ordered a substantial amount and some valuable gifts to be given to the high priest and aid continued to the temple until the death of Tipu Sultan.

ON THE ART OF WRITING ESSAYS (pb),"On the Art of Writing Essays is produced for those who face difficulties in writing essays. No doubt, writing essay is not an easy task. However, in almost all exams, the essay is always a very important question. Ironically, in Pakistan both the students of all levels as well as the academicians hardly seen very serious about their essays writing skills. As a result, the tradition as well as the practice of studying and writing essays as a passion is, tragically, going out of the fashion in our educational institutions. Very sadly, no any satisfactory literature is available to meet our board and university levels challenges of developing essay writing skills in students. I have made this every systematic effort to educate my readers in highly advanced tips and techniques of writing good essays in natural and organic style and to enable them to produce original, interest-arresting, well-framed, and speaking texts. I am quite sure that the readers will find this book very informative, educative, innovative, attractive, interesting, entertaining and very useful for all kinds of exams and tests ranging from board, university and to competitive exam level. This book is not only for students of all levels but also for literary and nonfiction readers as well as writers.

TANGLED KNOT OF KASHMIR VOLUME I (hb),"Tangled Knot of Kashmir covers the genesis of the tragedy from the very beginning to make the people understand the travails of Kashmiris, spread over centuries, and the atrocities and injustices meted out to them by so many ruling dynasties. All the rulers including the Indians have treated Kashmiris like ‘dumb driven cattle’.   Occupied Kashmir is described as the most militarized corner in the world where 750,000 Indian soldiers are battling few thousand ill-equipped and marooned Kashmiri Mujahedeen in the narrow Kashmir Valley since 1989 and persecuting peaceful citizens.  This book is a thoroughly researched treatise covering all aspects of the Kashmir saga from its origins till date in exhaustive detail. The author has put in colossal research work spread over many years. He reminds the world powers that Kashmir, which has become a nuclear flashpoint, needs urgent resolution.  The book has been divided into two volumes; it would be highly useful addition to the library of books written on Kashmir and would be of immense value to the students of contemporary history. It will help in understanding the reasons of the roots of Indo-Pak antagonism and as to why the Kashmir dispute remains unresolved.  Author:  Brig. Asif Haroon is a columnist, a defence analyst and an author of several books. Currently, he is a member of Executive Committee Pakistan Ex Servicemen Society presided by Lt. Gen. Hameed Gul, and is also Director of NEASAC Research Centre. His first book ‘Maarka Hilli’ gives an eyewitness account of the epic battle of Hilli in former East Pakistan in the 1971 War. His second book ‘Kashmir Battles’ contains explicit details about the battles during the 1948, 1965 and 1971 Wars as well as the ongoing freedom struggle. His third book ‘Muhammad Bin Qasim to Gen. Pervez Musharraf’ covers the entire span of Indian Muslim history from its origins. It lucidly describes the rise and fall of various Muslim dynasties as also discusses the making of Pakistan and birth pangs suffered by Pakistan during and after its inception and the political kaleidoscope up to current times together with security challenges. It makes highly absorbing reading.  His fourth book ‘Roots of 1971 Tragedy’, besides giving a vivid picture of historical perspective, dispassionately places together the entire chain of events which divided Pakistan into two in 1971. It discusses political and military aspects and carries out post mortem of each political and military leader as well as role of other countries. In the end, he critically analyses Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report. The author lifts the curtain on many puzzling issues and removes the fog of doubts arising out of myths and half-truths and sums up with meaningful inferences and lessons.  The present book ‘Tangled Knot of Kashmir: Indo-Pakistan Antagonism’ is a thoroughly researched treatise and a monumental scholastic work which, after dilating upon the history of Kashmir as well as the Indian subcontinent, delves into the genesis of Kashmir issue that has caused extreme pains to the Kashmiris and has bedevilled India-Pakistan relations and has led to nuclearisation of South Asia. It brings out the causation as to why this oldest issue lying in the pending tray of the UN since 1948 has not been resolved. India’s duplicity and dilly-dallying tactics to avoid giving the right of self-determination to the Kashmiris has been discussed in exhaustive detail. The author has offered objective suggestions how to untie the tangled knot. It is a valuable addition to the body of works available on Kashmir and the regional dynamics and is of immense value to the students of contemporary history.

JASMINE AND JOURNEYS: THE LIFE QUEST OF A SOUTH ASIAN WOMAN (hb),"“History, poetry, and autobiography merge in this beautifully written and moving account that takes us on a journey   from South Asia to Canada, from Mohammed bin Qasim to Justin Trudeau. It is a simple but powerfully written saga of a family struggling with the great issues of our times — diaspora, migration and prejudice — characterized by joy, heartbreak, hope and courage. The book carries the waft of the jasmine flower and is a gift that every reader should cherish.” Professor Akbar Ahmed Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies,  American University, Washington, DC  “Jasmine and Journeys by Najma Shamsi is a literary gem of a book and an enlightening read. What seemed to begin as an historical testimony for her children and grandchildren, ended up as a fascinating cultural and political history of the Indian sub-continent of South Asia. The story of Najma’s family is interwoven with the political history and culture of the times.  “The bonus for me, as I read deeper into the book, was discovering how little I really knew about the sub continent’s history and culture — the celebrations, the ceremonies, the rituals — as well as the social and political upheavals from ancient times through the British era, through partition of the sub-continent to the Pakistan of today, and from there on to frigid, but welcoming Canada. My knowledge of these challenging as well as fascinating times in the life of a people had been limited to the raw outlines painted in today’s hysterical media — in other words, virtual ignorance. Now, I feel as if I have a slightly better appreciation of how we got to where we are today, and a deeper understanding of events which have played a role in shaping our present world. Her family history and the portraits she paints are deeply personal and I am grateful that she decided to share them with us. I hated to say goodbye to them.” R. N. (Nick) Whitehead Ph.D. Chief Executive Officer rnw@oxfordlearning.com www.oxf   “Najma Shamsi’s warm account of one community’s many migrations is also the story of resilience and grace in times of catastrophic upheaval. Her knowledge is encyclopedic and her memory enviable. She has used both to give her grandchildren, and us, a timeless bulwark against loss.” Uzma Aslam Khan Award winning writer and author of Thinner Than Skin,  Trespassing, The Geometry of God and other works.

PAKISTAN: UNIQUE ORIGINS; UNIQUE DESTINY? THIRD REVISED EDITION (hb),"“ … Introduces many aspects of Pakistan largely unknown or unacknowledged … with precise, proven facts … extensive research and analysis … very pertinent … concise, easy-to-read … direct, straightforward.” —Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani, Prime Minister of Pakistan, 2008–12.  “A carefully researched, thoroughly analytical, persuasively argued and eloquently written work … a must-read … for all Pakistanis and for all those interested in South Asia.” — from the foreword by  HEC Distinguished Professor Sharif Al-Mujahid, (Sitara-i-Imtiaz).  “ ... a brilliant study ... well-researched ... a must-read ... to re-discover Pakistan ... ” —Ashish Shukla, India Quarterly. “Objective and innovative about what constitutes nation-hood in Pakistan. Moves ahead of others in the search for the uniqueness of Pakistan … deep insight into Pakistan’s past and present and reinforces confidence in the future.” —Dr Syed Jaffer Ahmed, scholar and former director,  Pakistan Study Centre, University of Karachi. Urdu and Sindhi language versions of this book have been published by the National Book Foundation, Islamabad.  What makes Pakistan truly one-of-a-kind? This book identifies 8 reasons why. And 2 not-so-good reasons that also make the country’s post-Independence history unique. In 2017 — 60 strengths. 40 weaknesses. 31 elements of the evolving national identity of Pakistaniat. Critical challenges and possible ways to address them. 5 factors most likely to shape the future. This book is of equal relevance for readers in Pakistan and around the globe — to better understand a uniquely-created nation-state destined for a significant role in world affairs in the 21st century.  Most of Pakistan’s 70-year history is marked by tumult, disruption and volatility. These features have diverted attention from the extraordinary factors and conditions that shaped the country’s birth. The new state also faced unmatched, formidable difficulties capped by dis-integration when East Pakistan became Bangladesh in 1971. West Pakistan then became the new Pakistan — to commence a new phase  of nation-building and state-building while ensuring survival amidst abiding and new regional tensions.  This remarkable book introduces a much-needed, evidence-based balance into appraisal and analysis of Pakistan. This revised, updated 3rd edition retains sharp focus on the country’s present in 2017 and possible trajectories in the decades to come. In short, lucid, easy-to-read chapters the book stimulates reflection and offers space for the reader’s own observations. To help identify how Pakistan can contribute to global peace, culture and harmony in the unfolding 21st century.

TO LIGHT A CANDLE AND KEEP IT BURNING (hb),"This is my story, the story of a German who has up to now lived for more than forty years in Pakistan, and has been very happy in her work, and with her patients, friends and co-workers and who loves the laughter and the sadness and the courage of the people, the beauty and the threatening grandeur of the country, and has suffered a lot witnessing the injustice and the violence and disregard for the dignity of the weak and the poor, and tried and struggled to add her small contribution to the fight against the evil and to strengthen the many many good and brave initiatives. But of course I have seen it with the eyes of a Westerner. And as this book is a kind of an account of my life, there will be many passages strange to my Muslim friends. However, this may not necessarily be a negative point because this mutual inter-cultural enrichment, which characterizes the Leprosy Programme of Pakistan, has only been possible because we have shared, listened to and clarified our ways of thinking, making this cross fertilization possible. —Ruth Pfau   Author: Ruth Pfau ",PKR495.00,RUTH PFAU,9789696373537,2017,BIO / AUTOBIOGRAPHIES,1,Hard Cover,English,246,images/books/9789696373537.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?title=To-Light-A-Candle-And-Keep-It-Burning-(hb)&ISBN=9789696373537&opt=3&SubCat=05&Cat=05003
IF BORN AGAIN... (hb),"A truly engrossing book whose premise is a hypothetical question, the title of the book — If Born Again. The first book of its kind, which attempts to bring together high achievers and inspiring people from India and Pakistan — the two great nations, struggling to achieve a lasting relationship of trust and peace, even after a long period of seven decades. Fluttering through their childhood fantasies, relating anecdotes from their eventful lives, this book has some truly remarkable quotes from those interviewed.  Highly imaginative questions put to these personalities, famous in their own world of human domain that they represent, has resulted in responses, which are really very distinctive and heartfelt. The narratives which emerge, if taken together, lead to one message conveyed by all — the message of love and harmony. All the twenty-two outstanding individuals interviewed are bonded by the cord of humanity. The arc of history favours those that courageously stand steadfast against the darkness of enmity to welcome a new dawn of friendship. This book serves to contribute in that great endeavour to build bridges across man-made chasms of separation and despair.

INDIFFERENCE IN THE TIMES OF EXTREMISM (hb),"A line borrowed from the different articles written over many years construct a collage and a mosaic of ideas that the book presents:  It is a pity we suffer from the very diseases the Father of the Nation had pointed out in the very first year of our existence. Our society badly suffers from a deep- rooted structural imbalance. This imbalance has been manifested time and again but no serious effort has been made to repair this manufacturing defect. We need to examine whether individuals here were responsible for their sad plight or society failed to create opportunities and the right environment for the individual to exist.  Our society exhibits a general trend to follow the herd. Fresh ideas, bold initiatives and new thoughts have stopped emerging. This denial of self-hood, disrespect for individuality and humiliation by the state, the government and society drives individuals to nothingness, indifference and makes them feel there is no purpose to their lives. Creativity is a must for the growth of individuals and the society. We have turned into a society of imitators, impostors and mimics. Our attitude as individuals or as a group at the national level is casual and encourages ad-hoc thinking. We want to live for the moment; we have no confidence in the moments yet to come.  Political parties formulate broad-based alliances for temporary interests and gains. They increase their strength and influence, but for the same reason they weaken from within. Different powers are at play in Pakistan. Every power has to play its role in its sphere, but if there is a vacuum lies in some part of society, the other part is likely to stretch itself to fill the vacuum.  Pakistan was still only three years old, and danger was being felt that some elements were undermining the s tate in the name of religion. Today, this disease is 55 years old and acute. Terrorism has been at its extremes in the past few years. This juncture of history is teeming with disputes, crisis and clashes but at the same time it offers countless opportunities. History tells us that such decisive crossroads have appeared before also but instead of seeing the objective, we were swept away in a flood of emotions. To dwell on the past or discuss it is an exercise in futility. Our destiny should be very different from the on-going events. We must decide our destiny, determine our goals and devise means that will lead us towards them.  We should be active and united to stop these forces of darkness. The wheels of history always trundle forward. Time is very short. Think - shake your conscience out of its slumber.

CIVIL MILITARY EQUATION IN PAKISTAN: PERCEPTION AND REALITY (hb),"Civil-military relations is the study of how the military interacts with the state and society. The management of civil-military relations is a key to effective governance, particularly in states undergoing the transition to democracy like Pakistan. Military is generally held in high esteem in Pakistan owing to its strong nationalistic character, keeping the arch rival India at bay despite the qualitative and quantitative differential and impressive performance in nation-building tasks. However, there is a perception that due to its perpetual stay in national polity, the civil-military relations are somewhat strained. Due to the authority and position it enjoys, perception of ‘military elitism’ has also emerged in the public, which draws criticism both locally and from abroad. The book is first of its type which gives out true picture of civil-military equation and suggests a pragmatic and viable options to keep this equation balanced for strengthening of our beloved country Pakistan.

MY DAWN YEARS: EXPLORING SOCIAL ISSUES (hb),"My DAWN Years Exploring Social Issues “A trail-blazer, Zubeida Mustafa has the courage of a journalist, the perfectionism of a researcher and an ability to see Pakistan through the lens of disadvantaged classes. In this fascinating memoir she tells us of her struggles to put social issues — education, health and social security — high on the national agenda. It also traces Dawn’s travel through technological revolutions in the print media, its efforts to bring out new features, such as Books & Authors, a sterling contribution to journalism and literature both. Further we learn about Dawn’s travails during the long spells of authoritarian rule, as it strove to deliver sane counsel to the state and the people, and to survive to fight for another day. A must read for journalists, their defenders and their victims both.”  I.A. Rehman Human rights activist and columnist  “My DAWN Years is simultaneously Zubeida Mustafa’s inspiring autobiography; an insider’s perspective on Dawn’s evolution; a ringside view of Pakistan’s tumultuous decades; an activist’s account of the struggle for women’s rights and socio-economic development.

THE CAMBRIDGE COMPANION TO BRITISH ROMANTIC POETRY (pb),"More than any other period of British literature, Romanticism is strongly identified with a single genre. Romantic poetry has been one of the most enduring, best loved, most widely read and most frequently studied genres for two centuries and remains no less so today. This Companion offers a comprehensive overview and interpretation of the poetry of the period in its literary and historical contexts. The essays consider its metrical, formal, and linguistic features; its relation to history; its influence on other genres; its reflections of empire and nationalism, both within and outside the British Isles; and the various implications of oral transmission and the rapid expansion of print culture and mass readership. Attention is given to the work of less well-known or recently rediscovered authors, alongside the achievements of some of the greatest poets in the English language: Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Scott, Burns, Keats, Shelley, Byron and Clare.  Newly commissioned essays by world experts cover a wide range of approaches to the field Each essay features a list of further reading suggestions tailored to students' needs Features a chronology of the major publications and events of the period  AUTHOR: Maureen N.

There are 20 titles to collect in the series, listed below, all with exciting new covers and fun-filled endnotes.  Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is the classic story of a girl growing up in the deep South.  'We have no choice of what colour we're born or who our parents are or whether we're rich or poor. What we do have is some choice over what we make of our lives once we're here.'  The Mississippi of the 1930s was a hard place for a black child to grow up in, but still Cassie didn't understand why farming his own land meant so much to her father. During that year, though, when the night riders were carrying hatred and destruction among her people, she learned about the great differences that divided them, and when it was worth fighting for a principle even if it brought terrible hardships.  Mildred D. Taylor was born in Mississippi and grew up in Ohio. She worked in Ethiopia with the Peace Corps before enrolling at the School of Journalism at the University of Colorado, where she helped develop a Black Studies programme.

This book is pathbreaking in that it examines for the first time, the issue of peacekeeping, from the prism of Pakistani national interests.  The book has been a labour of love.

He diligently accessed personal notes, photographs and regimental histories, archival records of newspapers and parliamentary debates and rare video clips of the peacekeeping operations to understand all angles of this operation.

ROBINSON CRUSOE (pb),"The sole survivor of a shipwreck, Robinson Crusoe is washed up on a desert island. In his journal he chronicles his daily battle to stay alive, as he conquers isolation, fashions shelter and clothes, first encounters another human being and fights off cannibals and mutineers. With Robinson Crusoe, Defoe wrote what is regarded as the first English novel, and created one of the most popular and enduring myths in literature. Written in an age of exploration and enterprise, it has been variously interpreted as an embodiment of British imperialist values, as a portrayal of 'natural man' or as a moral fable. But above all it is a brilliant narrative, depicting Crusoe's transformation from terrified survivor to self-sufficient master of his island.This edition contains a full chronology of Defoe's life and times, explanatory notes, glossary and a critical introduction discussing Robinson Crusoe as a pioneering work of modern psychological realism.  About The Author :  Daniel Defoe was born in 1660 in London, England. He became a merchant and participated in several failing businesses, facing bankruptcy and aggressive creditors. He was also a prolific political pamphleteer which landed him in prison for slander. Late in life he turned his pen to fiction and wrote Robinson Crusoe, one of the most widely read and influential novels of all time. Defoe died in 1731.",INR65.00,DANIEL DEFOE,9169351215820,2015,GENERAL FICTION,1,Paperback,English,144,images/books/9169351215820.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?title=Robinson-Crusoe-(pb)&ISBN=9169351215820&opt=3&SubCat=05&Cat=05009

NATION BUILDING PARADOXES IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN (hb),"The governing political elites in South Asia have failed to establish an ‘inclusive society’, at a time of profound global transformation and power shift. Even more unfortunate, Pakistan and India are bracing for yet another ‘lost era’ with their third generation gearing up for conflict. The chances of ‘sleepwalking’ into another conflict will always remain there. May be this time, both countries will walk into it, with their eyes wide open, but helpless. The ordinary people in South Asia have remained condemned to hope by those, who should have instead provided ‘solutions’ to them. India’s protracted struggle for geo-political domination, massive arms imports, resumption of threats and coercive diplomacy are ‘bad omen’ for South Asia’s future. The continuation of misery, poverty, extremism, intolerance and hate in South Asia is not only baffling, but is a matter of serious concern to all of its inhabitants, and the international community at large. In his book, Ambassador Hasan Javed examines the factors contributing to malaise in South Asia, the enormous systemic/good governance challenges, as well as the opportunities.

50 GASTROINTESTINAL CASES AND ASSOCIATED IMAGING (pb) 2016,"Medical students and junior doctors are integral to the healthcare system. On an academic gastroenterology service, they often initially evaluate patients before the arrival of the consulting physician. For all clinical specialties, acquisition of medical knowledge is required to gain expertise. Several resources are available for this purpose, including textbooks and evidence-based articles. This highly illustrated book, inspired by patient care, over’s a fresh approach to clinical teaching. “50 Gastrointestinal Cases and Associated Imaging” contains a gamut of cases for which gastroenterologists are commonly consulted in the hospital and outpatient settings. Each case is presented from the initial history and work-up, including imaging (various modalities, including endoscopy), followed by a brief discussion on management. Questions are presented to the reader in each case, immediately followed by the answers. Since each case is unique, the pertinent teaching points are tested in a question format within the case narrative. Similar to real-life scenarios, this helps the reader retain the most important information. Why buy this book? Unlike most review texts that just list the facts, this volume integrates teaching points into realistic clinical cases. Medical students through to residents or registrars in internal medicine, emergency medicine, gastroenterology and surgery will benefit it from reading the cases presented. Secondary audiences include radiologists who want to understand the presentation of common gastrointestinal cases, and general practitioners and nurses who are looking for a unique teaching tool and a way to review imaging. Finally, this book will make an excellent prerequisite for any individual prior to starting a gastroenterology rotation.  AUTHOR: ABDULLAH A SHEIKH, SYED M. HUSSAIN, ","PKR1,495.00",ABDULLAH A.

"TREATMENT GUIDE, 13e (pb) 2018","This book aims to help the practicing physician, in both the hospital and general practice environment by providing a core of sample prescriptions that can be used as such in treatments and as the physician gets more experience, he can adapt or even change these to suit his local requirements.   Trade names are more familiar and are used in prescriptions so these have been used in the samples; only one trade name of a generic substance is used to avoid confusion, this does not mean any endorsement of a particular brand over another; but the physician is cautioned against the veritable explosion of dubious pharmaceuticals and preparations and advises to choose good quality preparations.

COMPRENENSIVE MCQs IN OBS & GYNAE (pb) 2016,"MCQs are an integral component of all undergraduate and postgraduate examinations in Pakistan and worldwide. Most of our medical institutes are following the one best answer pattern. MCQs are an essential tool to evaluate the knowledge of students. In order to meet a persistent demand from my MBBS students and to fulfil my own aspiration to write a book on the subject, I ventured to write a concise book on the subject.  Comprehensive MCQs Obs & Gynae is the result of that endeavour. Writing a MCQs book is always a challenging job because one cannot specify the target readers. This book is basically designed for the undergraduate MBBS students by keeping in mind their learning needs. Postgraduate students can also benefit from this book.  All the MCQs are made according to general principles of medical education, in order to prevent the monotony different varieties of MCQs are included, without compromising the basic format. Learners can also test their skills to apply clinical knowledge by solving scenario based MCQs.  This book has 530 MCQs, before selecting MCQs from each topic, blueprinting was done and more MCQs were included from those topics which are important from examination point of view as well as which are commonly encountered in the practice of this specialty. This book is divided into two major sections, first is Obstetrics and second is Gynaecology. Obstetrics part contains 280 MCQs and Gynaecology part comprises 250 MCQs. Almost all of the main topics are covered and each section is further subdivided to facilitate readers in schematic preparation.  The section of answers and explanations is added in the last chapter of the book. If readers feel difficulty in answering a MCQ they can consult this section and correct their mistakes as such an exercise will pave their way towards active learning.

FCPS SUCCESS SERIES: REAL POOL WITH KEYS IN ALL SPECIALITIES OBSTETRICS & GYNAECOLOGY (pb) 2016,"‘FCPS Success Series’ is not only a collection of all questions usually crammed by candidates, but it is also a real pool of BCQs in all specialties of FCPS exam. Practising BCQs is an integral part of preparation before appearing in any examination nowadays. This book has been designed to practise questions alongwith explanations of answers. Not only that,   ‘FCPS Success Series’ is the first book of its kind which offers online subscription so that a candidate may get the most of practise sessions.  Passing the first component of FCPS exam is essential to be inducted into postgraduate clinical trainings in our country. According to the recent exam pattern of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, FCPS Part 1 examination is divided into two components. The first component is basic sciences common to all clinical specialties and the second component is   specific to that particular subject of interest. The questions are clinical scenario based, which mainly test the basic knowledge of a candidate. There may also be questions which have a direct theme checking factual knowledge. While compiling ‘FCPS Success’ Series, it was ensured that all questions have an authentic key with vivid explanations. This way, a student may not only practise questions, but explanations would strengthen the core concepts with better understanding. The emphasis remains on the facts and concepts related to basic sciences with enhanced knowledge.   We have sought references and explanations from authoritative books of all basic subjects, namely, Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Histology, Pathology, Pharmacology and those of specialities: Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Anaesthesia, Community Medicine, Dentistry. All this would not have been possible without the constant support of teachers, fellows   and colleagues who provided everything needed to produce this purposeful effort.

UNCHARTED TERRITORIES: ADVENTURES IN LEARNING (pb) 2018,"Hywel Roberts and Debra Kidd s 'Uncharted Territories: Adventures in learning' is a book of prompts, provocations and possibilities designed to nourish creativity and generate ideas that will get teachers and pupils excited about learning.  In this time of high-stakes testing, growing mental health issues among young people and increasing pressure on teachers to focus on rote repetition and practice papers, we have to step back and ask: What is the purpose of education? If you think it is to get children through tests, then this book is probably not for you. If, however, you think it is to develop wisdom in children the capacity to think, to apply knowledge, to empathize, to weigh up evidence, to consider consequences and to make informed choices then this book is most definitely for you.  Rooted in practice and grounded in research, Uncharted Territories invites a reassessment of what curriculum coverage can look like and provides an abundance of hooks into exploratory learning that place learners of whatever age knee-deep in dilemma, so that they are thinking deeply, analytically and imaginatively. These are not knowledge organisers or schemes of work; rather they are inspirational forays into imagined contexts for learning which, as fantastical as they may appear, always have the real world as their destination. Signposted by story starters and inductive questions not to mention the beautiful illustrations which are sure to fire children s imaginations Hywel and Debra s innovative routes to learning will help teachers stray from the beaten track of the curriculum and instil in learners a sense of purpose as they discover, manipulate and apply knowledge and skills across a range of collaborative, cross-curricular problem-solving contexts. Each chapter focuses on a different place such as a remote castle or a mysterious cave, where the learning will be applied and challenged and is packed with starting points and what ifs ...? to establish rich landscapes for exploration and a wide range of opportunities for discussion and writing. To help map out the territory ahead, Hywel and Debra guide the teacher around the key learning landmarks linked to each context s overarching concepts and lines of inquiry, and point out the many different curriculum areas to which the explorations naturally lend themselves to. The authors go further by offering transferable ideas which can be adjusted to work with whatever age group, as well as a variety of context-based tasks to enable the teacher to explore how elements of, for example, literacy and/or numeracy could be incorporated in order to save curriculum time.  While Uncharted Territories is a rallying call to arms for the imagination, in each of its chapters Hywel and Debra also delve into the why in order to present the teacher with a comprehensive debrief of the learning processes and the theoretical and academic underpinning. Furthermore, the authors provide a helpful listing of drama techniques and relevant books and poems that can be incorporated into the learning journeys, as well as useful advice on how to assess and evidence their outcomes.  Designed for use with learners of all ages, from early years to secondary.  Author: Hywel Roberts is a creative educator with 16 years experience in the classroom teaching secondary drama and English in schools, both rough and smooth. Hywel is now a freelance consultant and Independent Thinking Associate specialising in Drama for Learning, Mantle of the Expert, Lures into Learning and engagement across all phases of learning.  Debra Kidd was born in a house with an outside toilet and remembers her dad studying and moving their family to bigger houses with inside bathrooms: a living example of the value of education. She taught for 21 years in all phases of education, and has a doctorate in education. She lives in the north of England.",GBP16.99,HYWEL ROBERTS,9781781352953,2018,EDUCATION,,Paperback,English,152,images/books/9781781352953.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/LoginIndex.asp?title=Uncharted-Territories:-Adventures-In-Learning-(pb)-2018&Isbn=9781781352953&opt=3&sUBcAT=08&Cat=08016

LEADING THE LEADERS FOR THE FUTURE (pb)2008,"This book will address the leadership challenge of creating an environment for the development needs of 21st century students. These students need to be globally aware, flexible in approach, and to develop transferable, multi-skills across a wide spectrum of employment opportunities. They also need to be numerate, have highly defined social and communication skills and have an Information and Communication Technology skill base embedded within all that they do. In order to create the appropriate learning environment, every organisation must address as a first priority the way it is led. Schools must second guess needs for the future and put robust structures in place to facilitate those needs. This book will show how such a culture change is possible, note the barriers encountered and the successes achieved, both within schools and other organisations. Schools are one member of a group partnership with parents, employers, society and the students themselves - all of whom are charged with making this change happen. For this reason, the book looks at a number of business organisations to see what leadership lessons can be learned by both sides in this process of transformation.

"THE A LEVEL MINDSET: 40 ACTIVITIES FOR TRANSFORMING STUDENT COMMITMENT, MOTIVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY (pb)","Over their thirty plus years of teaching and coaching, Steve Oakes and Martin Griffin have discovered something very important. Those students who make real and sustained progress at A level aren't necessarily the ones with super test scores. In fact, some students who don't do well in middle school do very well in high school while some who have outstanding test scores don't do well in later years. But why? The answer is mindset. Successful students approach their studies with the right behaviors, skills and attitudes. They are no different cognitively, but they work more effectively, they are determined and better organized, they give more discretionary effort, and in turn, they get better results. In this book the authors share their secrets of coaching your students to grow their mindsets and get the best grades.  Suitable for teachers, tutors, or anyone else who wants to help students achieve their potential, this volume offers forty easy-to-use activities that will supercharge your learners' ambition, persistence and determination.

A MINDSET FOR SUCCESS: IN YOUR CLASSROOM AND SCHOOL (pb) 2017,"In A Mindset for Success: In Your Classroom and School, Tony Swainston analyses how the ways in which schools currently conceptualise and measure success could be limiting students potential to achieve it. It is critical for schools to move away from the many talent and IQ myths that presently exist and to stop categorising students in a way that damages their ability to grow and develop. Tony outlines key practical steps that can be taken in order to do just this, building instead a growth mindset culture in all classrooms and across schools.  A mindset for success can benefit everyone by giving more meaning to learning that, in turn, brings greater fulfilment for teachers and pupils. A Mindset for Success illustrates how grit, resilience, determination and perseverance can be nurtured in every child, enabling them to take on the challenges of life and our changing world, which will lead them to greater academic success and personal happiness. By exploring the importance of emotional intelligence and student well-being, it offers a holistic view of the academic and social development of students.  Educators will no doubt be aware of the theory of fixed and growth mindsets. That success can be a self-fulfilling prophecy and that attitudes to, and beliefs about, learning and intelligence profoundly influence academic outcomes is well-established. But how do you actually apply this in order to transform learning in classrooms and the organisational culture in schools? Drawing on ideas and research by Hattie, Dweck, Seligman, Goleman and Ericsson, amongst others, Tony outlines the latest thinking about mindsets and explores what schools can do to make a difference. Class teachers will find a plethora of techniques to get the best out of their learners, including strategies for coaching and deliberate practice, and affirmations to increase motivation and autonomy. For head teachers and senior leaders, there is advice about how to consistently involve all teachers, support staff and parents in order to have the greatest impact upon students mindsets.

THE LAZY TEACHER'S HANDBOOK- NEW EDITION: HOW YOUR STUDENTS LEARN MORE WHEN YOU TEACH LESS (pb) 2017,"It's more than six years since the bestselling Lazy Teacher's Handbook was first published and Jim Smith's Lazy Teaching philosophy has developed significantly in that time. This new revised edition details Jim s latest thinking on how to be the best lazy, but outstanding, teacher you can be. Every chapter has been revised and some significantly expanded, particularly those on planning, conducting and reviewing lazy lessons. Others have been updated with Jim s latest tried-and-tested techniques, which all shift the emphasis away from the teaching and onto the learning.  Have you ever wondered what would happen in your classroom if you simply stopped teaching? Over the last few decades the demands of countless education initiatives, not to mention the pressures good teachers put on themselves, have seen so much teaching squeezed into our lessons, it must have squeezed out some of the learning. Maybe if we spent a little less time teaching and gave students a little more time to learn, things would be different. Maybe this would allow us more opportunities to build relationships with the class and develop that all-important rapport with the individuals who might just need us most. Maybe we could even reclaim our Sunday afternoons from planning and marking?  The Lazy Way can help you get more out of your students and at the same time help you to get your life back. More than just a series of tricks, the Lazy Way is something Jim Smith has put together over years of experience working with all sorts of learners (and teachers) who want their lessons to be different yet still be rewarded with academic success. The approach was born out of Jim's frustration with doing a job he loves but being slowly killed by it in the process. And, as all good psychologists know, if necessity is the mother of invention then frustration is the absent father, and being knackered the grown-up sibling who just won t leave home.  If you want your students to learn more and you to work less, then The Lazy Teacher's Handbook provides you with all the arguments and evidence you need. The new edition is packed full of even more easy-to-apply, highly effective strategies (which Ofsted have rated as outstanding) all with the seal of approval from real students in real classrooms. So, next time someone tells you to get a life, this book will make it possible.
