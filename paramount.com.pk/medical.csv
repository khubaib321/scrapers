ATLAS OF THYROID AND NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR MARKERS (hb) 2018,"Presents updated and comprehensive explanations of thyroid tumors, NET and tumor cells Written by experts from different laboratory and clinical areas, allowing us to relate laboratory data to clinical applications Provides economic data (including simulations and sensitivity analysis) as part of a modern approach to medical diagnosis (“choosing wisely medicine”)  This book highlights the increase in thyroid tumors and NET and demonstrates the growing importance of circulating markers in diagnosis as well as treatment and follow-up. Dramatic technical improvements have heightened the clinical impact of well-established, conventional biochemical markers. In addition, more recent genetic and molecular approaches have provided innovative molecular markers. In this context, effective communication between clinicians and laboratory physicians/scientists is essential in allowing all those involved to fully profit from these exciting advances.  In this comprehensive, up-to-date book, authors from different laboratory and clinical areas link laboratory and clinical topics. Analytical problems such as interferences, false-negative and false-positive results are discussed in depth, and flow-charts offer insights into identifying and avoiding them. Illustrated clinical cases detail the clinical role and limitations of different tumor markers. Lastly, it explores health technology assessment and economic issues.  This is a valuable resource for endocrinologists, oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, scientists and technologists who want to keep abreast of the latest developments.

EXTRASKELETAL EFFECTS OF VITAMIN D: A CLINICAL GUIDE (hb) 2018,"Focuses exclusively on extraskeletal effects of vitamin D and its deficiency Discusses the role of vitamin D in autoimmune and infectious disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease and cognitive function Ideal for clinical endocrinologists and primary care physicians  While the skeletal effects of vitamin D are well-documented, the role and importance of vitamin D outside of bone health has not been well-established. Vitamin D receptors are located in nearly every tissue of the body, and low levels of vitamin D are associated with a range of various diseases.  This book provides an in-depth examination of these extraskeletal effects of vitamin D and the associations between vitamin D deficiency and various disease states. Beginning with a review of the biochemistry and physiology of vitamin D, subsequent chapters investigate its relationship to autoimmune and infectious diseases, various forms of cancer, endocrine issues such as diabetes, obesity and reproductive function, cardiovascular disease and muscle weakness. Concluding chapters discuss the role of vitamin D in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's Disease, and cognitive function.  Focusing on extraskeletal effects only across a range of conditions, Extraskeletal Effects of Vitamin D will be an important resource for clinical endocrinologists and primary care physicians.

CORE TOPICS IN THORACIC ANESTHESIA (hb) 2009,"Providing an easily readable source of information about the current spectrum of anesthesia and critical care management of patients undergoing thoracic surgery, this book forms part of the successful Core Topics brand. The book provides practical assistance to those commencing careers in thoracic anesthesia and will also to be a useful aide-memoire to those already working in the field. The comprehensive content includes discussion of some of the more contentious issues in the management of thoracic patients as well as giving a flavour of the rapid evolution of new techniques that are of increasing importance in the field, such as lung-assist devices, different modes of ventilation and VAT surgery. Both editors are practising cardiothoracic anesthetists/intensivists at an internationally recognized centre for thoracic surgery, particularly lung transplantation. The contributors are chosen for their clinical expertise and to give a spectrum of opinion across the range of thoracic anesthesia.  Authors:: Cait P. Searl (Editor), Sameena T.

"HANDBOOK OF METHODS FOR DESIGNING, MONITORING, AND ANALYZING DOSE-FINDING TRIALS (hb) 2017","Features Provides an overview of most up-to-date statistical methods required for design, monitoring and analysis for dose finding Focuses on the clinical aspects as well as statistical considerations Serves as a reference text for statistical methods for dose finding trials Can be used a textbook for a general graduate course that covers broadly statistical methods for dose finding trials Summary   Handbook of Methods for Designing, Monitoring, and Analyzing Dose-Finding Trials gives a thorough presentation of state-of-the-art methods for early phase clinical trials. The methodology of clinical trials has advanced greatly over the last 20 years and, arguably, nowhere greater than that of early phase studies. The need to accelerate drug development in a rapidly evolving context of targeted therapies, immunotherapy, combination treatments and complex group structures has provided the stimulus to these advances. Typically, we deal with very small samples, sequential methods that need to be efficient, while, at the same time adhering to ethical principles due to the involvement of human subjects. Statistical inference is difficult since the standard techniques of maximum likelihood do not usually apply as a result of model misspecification and parameter estimates lying on the boundary of the parameter space. Bayesian methods play an important part in overcoming these difficulties, but nonetheless, require special consideration in this particular context. The purpose of this handbook is to provide an expanded summary of the field as it stands and also, through discussion, provide insights into the thinking of leaders in the field as to the potential developments of the years ahead. With this goal in mind we present:   An introduction to the field for graduate students and novices   A basis for more established researchers from which to build   A collection of material for an advanced course in early phase clinical trials   A comprehensive guide to available methodology for practicing statisticians on the design and analysis of dose-finding experiments    An extensive guide for the multiple comparison and modeling (MCP-Mod) dose-finding approach, adaptive two-stage designs for dose finding, as well as dose–time–response models and multiple testing in the context of confirmatory dose-finding studies.   John O’Quigley is a professor of mathematics and research director at the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research based at the Faculty of Mathematics, University Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris, France. He is author of Proportional Hazards Regression and has published extensively in the field of dose finding.  Alexia Iasonos is an associate attending biostatistician at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She has over one hundred publications in the leading statistical and clinical journals on the methodology and design of early phase clinical trials. Dr. Iasonos has wide experience in the actual implementation of model based early phase trials and has given courses in scientific meetings internationally. Björn Bornkamp is a statistical methodologist at Novartis in Basel, Switzerland, researching and implementing dose-finding designs in Phase II clinical trials. He is one of the co-developers of the MCP-Mod methodology for dose finding and main author of the DoseFinding R package. He has published numerous papers on dose finding, nonlinear models and Bayesian statistics, and in 2013 won the Royal Statistical Society award for statistical excellence in the pharmaceutical industry.

BIOEQUIVALENCE AND STATISTICS IN CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 2e (hb) 2017,"Features •A wide range of examples, derived from drug development and regulatory applications, with data sets and analysis code available on the Internet. •Applications of statistics in clinical pharmacology drug development with an emphasis on scientific and regulatory applications. •Discussion of manufacturing, safety, pharmacokinetic, immunology, and efficacy assessment in biopharmaceutical development and clinical pharmacology, and where and how statistics fit in. •Presents the real-world use of statistical analysis and design of bioequivalence and clinical pharmacology studies for use in medical, scientific, and regulatory decision making and drug and vaccine labelling. Summary Maintaining a practical perspective, Bioequivalence and Statistics in Clinical Pharmacology, Second Edition explores statistics used in day-to-day clinical pharmacology work. The book is a starting point for those involved in such research and covers the methods needed to design, analyze, and interpret bioequivalence trials; explores when, how, and why these studies are performed as part of drug development; and demonstrates the methods using real world examples.   Drawing on knowledge gained directly from working in the pharmaceutical industry, the authors set the stage by describing the general role of statistics. Once the foundation of clinical pharmacology drug development, regulatory applications, and the design and analysis of bioequivalence trials are established, including recent regulatory changes in design and analysis and in particular sample-size adaptation, they move on to related topics in clinical pharmacology involving the use of cross-over designs. These include, but are not limited to, safety studies in Phase I, dose-response trials, drug interaction trials, food-effect and combination trials, QTc and other pharmacodynamic equivalence trials, proof-of-concept trials, dose-proportionality trials, and vaccines trials.   This second edition addresses several recent developments in the field, including new chapters on adaptive bioequivalence studies, scaled average bioequivalence testing, and vaccine trials.  Purposefully designed to be instantly applicable, Bioequivalence and Statistics in Clinical Pharmacology, Second Edition provides examples of SAS and R code so that the analyses described can be immediately implemented. The authors have made extensive use of the proc mixed procedures available in SAS.  Scott Patterson Head of Statistical Innovation, Sanofi Pasteur Swiftwater, PA, USA  ","PKR 16,847.00",SCOTT D.

CONTACT URTICARIA SYNDROME: DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT (hb) 2018,"Easily accessible guide for dermatologists and residents, as well as general practitioners, summarizing the most important concepts that will help physicians identify the signs and symptoms of Contact Urticaria Syndrome in their daily clinical practice Each chapter is laid out in the following format: Concepts, Tools and Algorithms of Diagnosis and Management, a Clinical Case for each entry, and Recommendations Provides a global approach to this syndrome using internationally standardized requirements for diagnosis Part of the Updates in Clinical Dermatology series  Contact urticaria is an immediate but transient localized swelling and redness that occurs on the skin after direct contact with an offending substance. It is caused by a variety of compounds, such as foods, preservatives, fragrances, plant and animal products, metals, and rubber latex and the mechanism by which these provoke an immediate urticarial rash at the area of contact can be divided into two categories: non-immunological contact urticaria and immunological (allergic) contact urticaria. Non-immunological contact urticaria typically causes mild localized reactions that clear within hours, e.g. stinging nettle rash. This type of urticaria occurs without prior exposure of a patient's immune system to an allergen. Immunological contact urticaria occurs most commonly in atopic individuals (people who are prone to allergy). Hence prior exposure to an allergen is required for this type of contact urticaria to occur.   While there have been other texts written on the subject over the last decade, this book is intended as an easily accessible guide for dermatologists and residents, as well as general practitioners, summarizing the most important concepts that will help physicians identify the signs and symptoms of Contact Urticaria Syndrome in their daily clinical practice. Each chapter is laid out in the following format: Concepts, Tools and Algorithms of Diagnosis and Management, a Clinical Case for each entry, and Recommendations.

A TREATISE ON TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS IN DERMATOLOGY (hb) 2018,"Topical corticosteroids have been available for more than six decades during which they have completely changed the face of therapy of dermatological disorders  Despite being the most useful drug for such treatment they are known to produce serious local, systemic and psychological side-effects when overused or misused  A separate book dedicated to topical corticosteroids has never been planned or executed  This treatise aims to fill up the lacuna and to contribute significantly to the dissemination of knowledge about the indication/contraindication, mechanism of action, ethical use, side-effects and various other facets related to topical corticosteroid. Topical corticosteroids (TC) have greatly enhanced dermatologists’ ability to effectively treat several difficult dermatoses. The available range of formulations and potencies allows them to flexibly treat all groups of patients, different phases of disease, and different anatomic sites. Improper/incomplete knowledge about topical corticosteroids’ mechanism of action, indications, classifications, and contraindications has produced a rapid rise in the incidence of improper use of these drugs, which could potentially bring disrepute to this entire group of amazing drugs.  Responsibility for disseminating proper knowledge regarding when, where, and how to use TC both to internists and patients primarily rests with dermatologists. In this regard, the benefits of rational and ethical use and the potential harm of overuse and misuse for nonmedical, especially cosmetic purposes, should be clearly conveyed before prescribing TC.  Author: Dr. Koushik Lahiri is the editor of the Indian Journal of Dermatology, one of the directors and vice president nominate of the International Society of Dermatology and the immediate past president of the Association of Cutaneous Surgeons of India.  Dr. Lahiri is a Foundation Fellow of the Asian Academy of Dermatology-Venerology, Fellow of IADVL Academy of Dermatology, Fellow of American Academy of Dermatology, and Founder council member of the Asian Skin Foundation and Asian Society for Pigment Cell Research (ASPCR).  He is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, FRCP (London and Edinburgh) and a member of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, MRCPS (Glasgow).  Dr. Lahiri is an editorial board member or reviewer for the British Journal of Dermatology, International Journal of Dermatology, Dermatology Online Journal, Egyptian Dermatology Online Journal, IJDVL, IJSTD etc.  Dr. Lahiri has published more than 100 articles in several indexed journals in the last two decades, and contributed several chapters in different textbooks. He has compiled an extremely popular mega project ‘100 interesting cases in Dermatology’ and edited a highly acclaimed exhaustive compendium ‘Pigmentary Disorders’ and the first ‘Textbook of Lasers in Dermatology’.  He has received various national and international awards, including the two highest orations awards for Indian Dermatologists, the Dr. B M Ambady memorial oration and Dr. P N Behl oration.  As the former honorary national general secretary of IADVL Dr. Lahiri conceptualized and proposed the IADVL Academy of Dermatology, which has now become the academic lifeline for Indian dermatologists. ACSI Academy of Dermatosurgery was also his brain child.  Today his name is inseparable with an extremely familiar entity among the dermatologist community in India, TSDF or Topical Steroid Dependent/Damaged Face – a term he coined.  As a tireless protagonist in the fight against the misuse of topical corticosteroids in India, Dr. Lahiri has worked relentlessly to sensitize other doctors (even dermatologists), government agencies, chemists, media and the common people regarding this shameful practice. As the founder chairperson of the countrywide IADVL Taskforce Against Topical Steroid Abuse (ITATSA) he became the face of a historic and epoch-making movement of Indian Dermatologists.  As the sixth-ever Indian he has received the International League of Dermatology Societies (ILDS) prestigious Certification of Appreciation (CoA) award. He was the first Indian to be honored for outstanding leadership, with special recognition from the Rutgers State University of New Jersey and New Jersey Medical School Chapter of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society.","PKR 20,433.00",KOUSHIK LAHIRI,9789811046087,2018,MEDICAL > DERMATOLOGY / VENEREOLOGY,1,Hard Cover,English,333,images/books/9789811046087.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?title=A%2DTREATISE%2DON%2DTOPICAL%2DCORTICOSTEROIDS%2DIN%2DDERMATOLOGY%2D%28hb%29%2D2018&isbn=9789811046087&opt=3&SubCat=06&Cat=06041

OBESITY TYPE 2 DIABETES AND THE ADIPOSE ORGAN (hb) 2018,"A Pictorial Atlas from Research to Clinical Applications Describes anatomic and morphologic aspects of adipose tissues relevant to obesity therapy Presents new results regarding adipose organ anatomy in different physiologic conditions Introduces white-to-pink transdifferentiation of adipocytes and its implications  This richly illustrated book provides a detailed description of the gross anatomy, light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy of the adipose organ, which comprises subcutaneous and visceral fat depots. Findings in mice of differing genetic backgrounds (obesity prone and resistant) and maintained in standard and various physiologic and pathologic conditions are presented. The latter conditions include chronic cold exposure, warm exposure, fasting, pregnancy–lactation, and obesity. Features of the fetal adipose organ are described in a separate chapter, and results from transgenic mice are also presented when relevant. The human adipose organ is addressed in several chapters that include magnetic resonance and fetal findings. Most of the results regarding the adipose organ anatomy in different physiologic conditions are new, and the story of pink adipocytes (white-to-pink transdifferentiation) is quite innovative. The concept of using browning of the adipose organ as a therapeutic tool for obesity must take into consideration the anatomic and morphologic aspects described here, and the study of pink adipocytes could lead to a better comprehension of breast cancer tumor biology. This book will be of interest to all scientists who deal with obesity and related disorders.

These rare diseases must now be considered when the mundane diagnoses do not exactly fit the patient’s clinical history or treatment fails. Some of these diseases include: eosinophilic esophagitis, blastocystis hominis infection, and paromyces allergic fungal sinusitis. Chapters provide in depth clinical examples of a wide range of diseases affecting multiple organ systems. Each case is structured by: a vignette of the case, background / salient features of the case, diagnosis, treatment, key points, and questions to aid in critical thinking. Unusual Diseases with Common Symptoms: A Clinical Casebook is of great interest to practicing physicians and as a teaching resource for students and residents who will one day encounter conditions more complex than they initially appear.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE 3e (pb) 2017,"In this new 3rd edition, the authors have made every effort to keep the text concise. They have attempted to base as much of the discussion of heart failure management on pathophysiologic principles as possible. They have provided references, whenever possible, to review articles and sound meta-analyses rather than primary data so that readers have access to the overall weight of evidence on a question. Technical abbreviations are listed with definitions in Chapter 12. The format the authors have employed emphasizes the graphic display of information: Kaplan-Meir plots of mortality and re-hospitalization data. Forrest plots to show subgroup analyses, and tables to summarize lists. For any given patient, prognosis may vary widely based on demographics and comorbidities; they have emphasized the importance of careful, complete evaluation and management. In addition, clinicians should exercise the option for consultation with an experienced heart transplant/mechanical cardiac support device center early in the heart failure management process. The authors hope this volume will be a useful adjunct to health care professionals in practice, particularly those in the early stages of their careers. Their intent is for it to be handy, to be available, and to be easy to use.

TREATMENT GUIDE 13e(pb)2018,"This book aims to help the practicing physician, in both the hospital and general practice environment by providing a core of sample prescriptions that can be used as such in treatments and as the physician gets more experience, he can adapt or even change these to suit his local requirements.   Trade names are more familiar and are used in prescriptions so these have been used in the samples; only one trade name of a generic substance is used to avoid confusion, this does not mean any endorsement of a particular brand over another; but the physician is cautioned against the veritable explosion of dubious pharmaceuticals and preparations and advises to choose good quality preparations.

NEONATAL INFECTIONS (hb) 2018,"Covers infections in delivery, congenital infections, and outbreaks in the nursery Includes 80 tables and figures for ease of use Written by expert in infectious diseases, neonatal, and perinatal medicine  There are approximately 4 million newborns annually in the United States, including 400,000 infants born preterm.  This care occurs in nurseries of all acuity levels, sizes, and regions across the country and is provided by a variety of providers, including pediatricians, family practice doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.  The most common complication during the newborn period is suspected or proven infection – either those acquired during the delivery itself or before delivery in the womb.  Indeed, 4 of the 8 most commonly-prescribed medications in newborns annually are antibiotics. Therefore, these providers must all be knowledgeable about the clinical presentation, epidemiology, and approach to diagnosis, treatment and prevention of neonatal infections.  However, many of these nurseries do not have convenient access to pediatric infectious disease consultation or support, and would benefit from a convenient reference guide. This book effectively and succinctly covers the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, approach to diagnosis and treatment, and important aspects of preventative care for the most frequently encountered neonatal and congenital infections.  The first section discusses common neonatal infections (i.e., those acquired during or after delivery), including sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, and other focal infections.  The second section covers the most frequently encountered congenital infections (i.e., those acquired via the placenta while the fetus is still in-utero).  Finally, the concluding section discusses the basics of infection prevention in the nursery setting, including general principles of infection prevention, how to apply those principles to families, and how to manage a suspected outbreak of infection within a nursery. This book is a unique contribution to the field. Existing texts such as the AAP Red Book fold neonatal infections in within chapters on a given pathogen, but the information is difficult to find and access quickly.  By covering neonatal and congenital infections thoroughly while still keeping each section clear and concise, this Handbook will be a valuable resource for the busy nursery provider.  Author: Dr. Cantey is a board certified neonatalist specializing in infectious diseases and perinatal medicine.  He received his medical degree from the Medical University of South Carolina in 2006 before completing his fellowships in pediatric infectious diseases and neonatal/perinatal medicine at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center.  He has published numerous journal articles and book chapters and is currently an assistant professor at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine.","PKR 22,291.00",JOSEPH B.

CLINICAL METHODS IN PAIN MEDICINE 2e(hb)2017,"Pain medicine or pain management is recognized as thirty-fourth speciality in the USA and as a separate specialty in many other countries. Unfortunately there are no separate clinical methods developed for this specialty. Pain medicine is strengthening and a larger number of physicians are now taking to pain management, though they are evaluating the patients in their own ways. There is a desperate need of systematic way of evaluation of the patients suffering from pain. Pain medicine started as a palliative care with the intention just to give pain relief in incurable disease. Later, it broadened its approach to cure other painful curable diseases too. There is a definite need to make diagnosis of the painful conditions, and follow a systematic approach of evaluation of patients suffering from pain. This book makes the first attempt to develop clinical methods in pain medicine based on analysis and compilation of available literature and clinical methods in other similar specialties Chapters have been planned to cover regional symptoms like headache, neck pain, low back pain, etc. Each chapter includes separate section to identify red flags or danger signals, flowcharts or algorithms to narrow diagnosis, and suggested investigations to confirm diagnosis.

APPROACH TO GERIATRIC NEUROPSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS (pb)2012,"Geriatric neuropsychiatry is an integrative activity bridging the fields of psychiatry, neurology, neuroscience and geriatrics. It reflects commitment to the principles that, improved understanding of brain-behavior relationships can lead to a higher quality of life for older individuals. Psychiatric manifestations of neurological disorders and the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disorders are the two pillars standing apart to hold erect the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuropsychiatry is devoted to understanding the neurobiological basis of human behavior. Measurement of cognitive functions and its steady decline is probably the most important evidence of effects of aging on neurology. Young physicians are more inclined to treat acute geriatric problems than the chronic neurological conditions. Many of their conditions are therapeutically controllable if they are detected early. This book deals with study of the effects of aging itself and the age-related diseases on the nervous system. Addresses disorders related to sleep, mood, dementing, neoplastic, nerve, muscle, gait, neurological, and describes managing complex issues for both primary and secondary prevention of geriatric illness. The book will be immensely helpful for those interested in study in the areas of Gerontology, Gerontologic neurology and neuropsychiatry.

LUNG DISEASE IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (hb) 2018,"This book addresses the manifestation of lung disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Lung disease in RA is common and often associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This stems partially from the nature of RA and partially from the many therapies used to manage RA that are associated with pneumotoxicity. Despite the severity and commonality of this comorbidity, little has been written on the topic. This book thus takes a multidisciplinary approach to provide: a concise overview of RA and why lung disease so commonly coincides with it; overviews of the specific lung diseases, including interstitial lung disease, and their epidemiology, associated imaging, histopathology, biomarkers, and management; a presentation of risk factors for these diseases; and specifics on what still needs to be uncovered about these pulmonary manifestations. Lung Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis is a comprehensive and practical resource for clinicians and clinician scientists in pulmonology, rheumatology, pathology, and primary care.

BEST PRACTICE PROTOCOLS FOR PHYSIQUE ASSESSMENT IN SPORT (hb) 2018,"Outlines best practice protocols for body composition analysis Validates the utility of new technologies for anthropometry  An essential reference for sports practitioners involved in physique assessment of elite athletes  This book outlines best practice protocols for body composition analysis of high-performance athletes and provides guidance on the use of new technologies for anthropometry. While surface anthropometry has traditionally been used to assess body composition through the internationally recognised methodology of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK), the recent commercialisation of devices, such as bioelectrical impedance technologies, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), ultrasound, 3D photometry and air-displacement plethysmography (Bod Pod), has led to the non-standardised adoption of new measurement techniques. In this textbook, leading researchers detail standardisation procedures for each technology: in terms of athlete preparation, test protocols, test reporting, equipment calibration and data interpretation. Each chapter covers a different tool: how it works, what it is used to measure, and what the issues are surrounding its validity, practicality and reliability. This book provides an essential reference for device technicians and sport practitioners, ensuring that high-performance athletes are afforded accurate and comparable body composition information to guide their training routines.

CENTRAL PAIN SYNDROME (hb) 2018,"This book sheds new light on central pain, a field that is largely obscured by lack of knowledge among pain professionals at all levels, including high-end pain centers. As a matter of fact, central pain, classified as a form of neuropathic pain, remains too often a scourge for those affected due to the ignorance of pain therapists worldwide and enduring misconceptions at the academic level. By weighing up the relevant evidence, the authors aim to remedy the situation by providing clear-cut, no-nonsense, unbiased and directly applicable clinical information.  The clinically sound guidelines presented here are based on the authors’ twenty years of treating patients and conducting research in the field. The book will be an invaluable guide for neurologists, neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists, pain therapists as well as physiotherapists.  About thte Authors: Sergio Canavero, functional neurosurgeon, is professor (hon. c.) at Harbin Medical University in China. Dr. Canavero founded and led the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group, a think-tank devoted to the advancement of brain stimulation techniques, for 20 years. He invented Extradural Motor Cortex Stimulation for Parkinson Disease, Bifocal Extradural Cortical Stimulation for Stroke Rehabilitation and the Vegetative State, and discovered the mechanism of Central Pain Syndrome at age 27. He has over 100 peer-reviewed publications and several books to his credit, and serves as a reviewer for some of the most important scientific journals like Nature Reviews, New England Journal of Medicine, Brain, Neuroimage, and Pain.

DEMENTIA AND THE ADVANCE DIRECTIVE (hb) 2018,"This unique title offers a novel exploration into the world of advance directives for patients with dementia.  Based on real life ethics consultations the expert author has undertaken, the cases depict fascinating and challenging moral issues arising in a variety of healthcare facilities.  The dynamics of the interdisciplinary health care teams of these patients, along with the dynamics of the families who are grappling to best serve their loved ones, are outlined and assessed; and the role each player’s personal histories have on the ethical issues and their resolution in real life are explored.  Following each case study, the author applies a range of concepts introduced in the beginning of the book to the relevant case study, thus integrating theory with a case-based approach.  A user-friendly question-and-answer format provides a thought provoking and accessible learning experience for readers.

METASTATIC SPINE DISEASE: A GUIDE TO DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT (hb) 2018,"This comprehensive text focuses exclusively on the management of metastatic spinal disease, evaluating the most recent literature and providing patient-centered treatment algorithms. Beginning with initial imaging, classification and clinical decision-making, the spine is approached anatomically from the upper cervical to the sacrum, describing the unique considerations and approaches appropriate to each region, such as laminectomy and stabilization, en bloc spondylectomy and resection and reconstruction. Less invasive and minimally invasive approaches are discussed throughout the text. Radiation therapy modalities and other adjuvant treatments are also discussed, as well as reconstructive flap coverage and the management of complications.   The spinal column is the most common site of metastatic cancer, and a multidisciplinary approach is required to provide patients with reasonable management options to prevent and treat the disabling symptoms caused by this debilitating condition. This compendium of experience from thought leaders in the treatment of metastatic spine disease will provide spine surgeons, oncologists, radiation oncologists, physiatrists and palliative care specialists with up-to-date information to guide their patients through the multidisciplinary management of metastatic spinal disease.

Many of the topics will be of interest not only to forensic pathologists but also to general pathologists, whether practitioners or researchers. Examples include the pathology of drug abuse, wound age determination, adverse drug reactions, histopathology of the sudden infant death syndrome, and age determination of myocardial infarction. Both typical and unusual findings are demonstrated with the aid of numerous high-quality color illustrations, and other key literature in forensic histology and immunohistochemistry is highlighted for each topic.  Author:  Professor Reinhard Dettmeyer is Head of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at Justus-Liebig University, Giessen, Germany. Professor Dettmeyer is qualified in both general pathology and forensic pathology, and studied medicine at the University of Düsseldorf and jurisprudence at the Ruhr University, Bochum. Prior to taking up his post in Giessen, he was Senior Physician in the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Bonn.  He has written many journal articles on forensic pathology and is co-author of several German language books on child abuse, forensic medicine, and medicolegal issues; in addition, he acted as scientific editor for Volume 2 of the comprehensive Handbuch Gerichtliche Medizin (Handbook of Forensic Medicine).

NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION FOR PHYSIOTHERAPISTS (pb) 2018,"This book is aimed to provide a simple framework for physiotherapy students to perform a straightforward neurological examination. Neurological examination is used as an investigative tool in patients when a neurological abnormality is found on screening or when an abnormality can be expected from history. There is no ideal neurological examination technique. There are conventional ways to perform an examination. Most neurologists have developed their own system for examination—a variation on conventional techniques. This book teaches the necessary mental and manual skills for neurological examination. Assessment of all neurological conditions dealt by the physiotherapists has been included in the book which will be of great use for the users. This book is written keeping in mind the graduate as well as the postgraduate students of physiotherapy who want to carry out basic neurological assessments. It mainly focuses on basic assessment only not the differential diagnosis. Scales used for general neurological examination as well as disease- specific scales used by physiotherapists are also included in the book, which will be very helpful for postgraduate students. Key Features • Presents the subject matter in self-explanatory manner with diagrams and tables at appropriate places to enable the effective understanding among students  • Discusses every topic with adequate content  • Provides a firm foundation in understanding and remembering the techniques of neurological examination  • Covers case-wise assessment of common neurological conditions treated  • Encloses disease-specific scales.

PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS (pb) 2018,"Features practical guidance for parent education regarding common pediatric mental health concerns Describes evidence-based behavioral and pharmacologic interventions for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder and substance-use disorder Includes medication tables by disorder for easy reference Edited by mental health experts with experience providing integrated care and acting as consultants in outpatient primary care settings and written by experts in psychiatry and psychology Provides valuable information on highly relevant topics such as trauma, cultural humility, resilience, medicolegal considerations, and mental health screening  The purpose of this book is to provide a children’s mental health resource tailored to the needs of physicians working with children. There are currently no such texts, despite the fact that there are patient care, healthcare systems, and workforce factors that indicate a strong need for such a resource.  Approximately 1 in 5 children are diagnosed with a mental illness by the age of 18. Additionally, mental health conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, are consistently among the most common chronic conditions in pediatric clinical populations. Delays in both diagnosis and treatment increase the morbidity associated with these conditions. These delays expose the child to negative ramifications of his/her illness and can impact rates of poor academic performance, substance use disorders and criminal justice system involvement – potentially impacting long-term life trajectories. Early identification of mental illness and appropriate intervention is critical to the healthy development of youth, though physicians in primary care and pediatrics are seldom trained to detect and treat such illnesses.  The importance of recognizing mental illness is reflected in practice guidelines for pediatric primary care providers as well as in how service delivery is being structured, but this does not offer in-depth clinical guidelines. Additionally, integrated care and medical home models include mental health as key components, though yet again physicians are often not trained to work with these models. While clearly indicated clinically, these requirements do not come with significant increases in reimbursement and are added to an already demanding schedule. Increasingly, providers are also expected to use evidence based screening instruments without exposure to this body of literature. Some guidance on using those instruments in context will help them to use those tools more effectively.  Finally, primary care providers and even some adult psychiatrists and psychologists are operating in a healthcare system with a severe, nationwide shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists and mental healthcare providers. While a text certainly cannot single-handedly compensate for such a workforce shortage, it could potentially help to mitigate the negative impact on patients by facilitating early identification and treatment in the primary care setting. Additionally, with more effective treatment in pediatric settings, less complex cases may be addressed before specialty care is needed, and the expertise of child and adolescent psychiatrists can be more effectively used for more complex cases.  Pediatric Psychiatry in Primary Care is the ultimate resource for clinicians working with children, including pediatricians, family physicians, general psychiatrists, psychologists, early career child psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, school counselors, and all clinical professionals who may encounter children struggling with psychiatric disorders.

PHENOMENOLOGY OF SUICIDE: UNLOCKING THE SUICIDAL MIND (hb) 2018,"Helps the reader to understand the suicidal mind from a phenomenological point of view Promotes an approach to suicide prevention that stresses the role of empathy Highlights the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition Examines the feelings of clinicans when confronted with potentially suicidal patients  This book will help the reader to understand the suicidal mind from a phenomenological point of view, shedding light on the feelings of suicidal individuals and also those of clinicians. In accordance with the importance that the phenomenological approach attaches to subjectivity and sense of self as the starting points for knowledge, emphasis is placed on the need for the clinician to focus on the subjective experiences of the at-risk individual, to set aside prior assumptions, judgments, or interpretations, and to identify ways of bridging gaps in communication associated with negative emotions. The vital importance of empathy is stressed, drawing attention to the insights offered by neuroimaging studies and the role of mirror neurons in social cognition.  It is widely acknowledged that when a clinician meets a person who wants to die by suicide, the clinician does not fully understand what is going on inside the mind of that individual. This book recognizes that any approach to suicide prevention must promote understanding of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The awareness that it fosters and the innovative perspectives that it presents will appeal to a wide readership.

PHYSICIAN MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING (hb) 2017,"Discusses mental health problems among physicians Based on the authors’ practical experiences Provides approaches to achieve a healthy work-life balance  This book explores the important topic of mental health and related problems among physicians, including trainees. The all-too-common human response of “suffering in silence” and refusing to seek help for professional and personal issues has ramifications for physicians who work in safety-sensitive positions, where clear-headed judgment and proper action can save lives. Problems covered include burnout, disruptive and unprofessional behaviors, impaired performance, traumatic stress, addiction, depression and other mood disorders, and suicide.  The authors of this work include psychologists, psychiatrists, and other physicians who diagnose and treat a range of patients with stress-related syndromes. Among their patients are physicians who benefit greatly from education, support, coaching, and treatment.  The book's content is organized into three parts with interconnecting themes. Part I focuses on symptoms and how physicians’ problems manifest at the workplace. Part II discusses the disorders underlying the manifesting symptoms. Part III focuses on interventions at both the individual and organizational levels. The major themes investigated throughout the book are developmental aspects; mental health and wellbeing as a continuum; and the multifactorial contributions of individual, interpersonal, organizational, and cultural elements to physician health. This book is intended for anyone who works with, provides support to, or professionally treats distressed physicians. It is also intended for healthcare leaders and organizations that are motivated to improve the experience of providing care and to change the culture of silence, such that seeking help and counsel become normal activities while minimizing stigma.  By writing this book, the authors aim to outline effective pathways to well-being and a healthy work-life balance among physicians, so that they may provide optimal and safe care to their patients.

HYPOFRACTIONATED AND STEREOATACTIC RADIATION THERAPY (pb) 2018,"This handbook summarizes the data and techniques for hypofractionation and stereotactic radiation in a clinically-accessible way. Hypofractionated radiation therapy, which consists of larger-dose radiation treatments that are given over a shorter time period compared to conventional radiation fraction sizes, is used to treat a variety of cancers, including prostate, breast, lung,  and colorectal.  Conventional radiation therapy and hypofractionated radiation therapy have different effectiveness rates for cancer treatment and have different impacts on normal tissues in terms of causing toxicity. There is a significant and growing body of literature on the use of different dosing regimens to treat a variety of cancers and radiation oncologists need to keep up with the various dosing schedules, the effect of each regimen on cancer control in different cancers, and how the different schedules affect each organ in terms of toxicity. The book thus provides concise information ranging from commonly-used dose-fractionation schemes for hypofractionated and stereotactic body radiotherapy to simulation and treatment specifications to published safety and efficacy data. Chapters additionally examine the biological rationales for the efficacy of hypofractionated radiation; present clinical studies that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated radiation treatment in a variety of cancers; and describe the advances in technology that have allowed hypofractionated radiation to be safely given. This is an ideal guide for radiation oncology clinicians and trainees.

RADIATION ONCOLOGY FOR PEDIATRIC CNS TUMORS (hb) 2018,"Addresses specifics of pediatric neuro-radiation oncology Covers recent advances in diagnosis and radiotherapy techniques Written and edited by world leaders in pediatric radiotherapy  This book reviews the principles and applications of radiotherapy in the management of pediatric brain tumors to allow the reader to gain a full appreciation of the major aspects involved in caring for these patients. Individual sections are devoted to basic principles, specific management for the full range of tumor entities, radiotherapy techniques, and potential toxicities and their management. The book is written and edited by world leaders in pediatric radiotherapy, and care has been taken to cover the latest advances in diagnosis and radiotherapy techniques. Pediatric brain tumors represent a diverse group of neoplasms that require carefully planned management for successful definitive treatment. Radiotherapy is one of the fundamental components in treatment for the majority of these vulnerable patients. The optimal radiation therapy approach will depend on multiple factors, including tumor type and location, extent of disease, age of the patient, and other therapies. A  thorough understanding of the natural history of the disease, communication with the multidisciplinary team, full knowledge of available radiotherapy techniques, and consideration of potential acute and late toxicities are therefore essential for each patient.    Author: Anita Mahajan, Arnold Paulino  Anita Mahajan is a Professor at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.  She has had a keen interest and experience in the treatment of pediatric patients with brain tumors.  Over her career she has worked with advanced radiotherapy delivery systems and makes an effort to use the best approach for individual patients.  She has become an authority on proton therapy in children and is currently working on refining the use and role of particle therapy for children.  She is an author of over 100 peer reviewed journals, book chapters and has edited several books.    Dr. Arnold Paulino, Prof. at the Department of Radiology at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.","PKR 24,149.00",ANITA MAHAJAN,9783319554280,2018,MEDICAL > RADIOLOGY / IMAGING,1,Hard Cover,English,639,images/books/9783319554280.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?title=RADIATION%2DONCOLOGY%2DFOR%2DPEDIATRIC%2DCNS%2DTUMORS%2D%28hb%29%2D2018&isbn=9783319554280&opt=3&SubCat=06&Cat=06035

Atlas of Suturing Techniques: Approaches to Surgical Wound, Laceration, and Wound Repairgoes beyond the scope of other texts, which often limit their focus to either general operative principles or the specific use of flaps in particular reconstructive areas, such as facial and nasal reconstruction. While these texts provide insufficient coverage of actual suture placement techniques, this one-stop resource excels at providing a clear, easy-to-follow atlas of suturing—one that enables you to prevent scars and other negative patient outcomes. Unfortunately, even the best designed repair can be undone by less-than-optimal suturing techniques.  •Reviews the fundamental principles of suturing and wound repair in an accessible, affordable Atlas format •Covers 25 suture techniques and provides unique, step-by-step instructions with precise drawings and photos of the techniques •Includes 80 videos  AUTHOR: Jonathan Kantor ","PKR 21,086.00",JONATHAN KANTOR,9780071836579,2016,MEDICAL > PLASTIC SURGERY,1,Hard Cover,English,384,,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?title=ATLAS%2DOF%2DSUTURING%2DTECHNIQUES%3A%2DAPPROACHES%2DTO%2DSURGICAL%2C%2DWOUND%2C%2DLACERATION%2DAND%2DCOSMETIC%2DREPAIR%2D%28hb%29%2D2016&isbn=9780071836579&opt=3&SubCat=06&Cat=06037

ATLAS OF ENDOSCOPIC MAJOR PULMONARY RESECTIONS (pb) 2018,"No similar book dealing with this subject Recognized experience in this field Presented as a technical atlas High quality pictures (from HDTV camera system)  The first version of this atlas was released as video-assisted major pulmonary resections were just emerging as a valid alternative to conventional techniques.  In this second edition, many different techniques have been described, depending on the use or non-use of an accessory mini-thoracotomy and on the use or non-use of endoscopic instrumentation and video display. One of these techniques is the totally endoscopic approach, in which only endoscopic instruments and monitor control are used. This is the technique that will be described in this atlas. The purpose of this atlas is to describe each endoscopic pulmonary lobectomy and segmentectomy step by step, relying on brief technical notes and high-quality still pictures which are orientated and labeled to make them as comprehensible as possible. Each chapter is introduced by an anatomical background which is illustrated by three-dimensional reconstructions. Technical «tricks» and specific dangers are mentioned by pictograms. The technical descriptions of this atlas are based on the author’s technique, which can be different from other video-assisted approaches. Our intent is that surgeons embarking in video-assisted major pulmonary resections-whatever the approach they use-can find helpful hints and take their bearings in this totally new vision of pulmonary and mediastinal anatomy.Compared to the previous version, all chapters have been rewritten, taking into account the progresses of the technique and the technology and some new chapters have been added.

URODYNAMICS FOR UROGYNECOLOGISTS: A POCKET GUIDE FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE (pb) 2018,"This book offers gynecologists and urogynecologists a pocket guide to urodynamic testing in women with lower urinary tract symptoms. In female urology, the main indications for urodynamics are urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, urgency-frequency syndrome (also known as overactive bladder), emptying disorders and painful bladder. By collecting quantitative measurements while reproducing the patient’s voiding symptoms where appropriate and possible, urodynamics helps to identify the cause of symptoms, supports management and facilitates prognoses. However, despite the undeniable advantages, the role of urodynamics in female urology is hotly debated. The book starts by describing the physiological background and methodological considerations for urodynamic best practice in the preclinical setting. It then explains how to perform urodynamics correctly – so-called “good urodynamic practice” – to increase the readers’ confidence and ability to perform and interpret urodynamic investigations. Lastly, it reviews the advantages and disadvantages of urodynamic testing in each of the key clinical female urology conditions. A separate chapter focuses on the peculiarities of diagnosis and management for female patients with neurogenic bladder. This guide offers a valuable tool for gynecologists, urologists and urogynecologists, as well as a ready source of information for all physicians involved in diagnosing and treating lower urinary tract disorders in women.  ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Giancarlo Vignoli is a consultant urologic surgeon at Casa di Cura Madre Fortunata Toniolo, Bologna, Italy.

HANDBOOK OF NUTRITION IN KIDNEY DISEASE (pb) 2018,"In patients of chronic kidney disease, the management of malnutrition is a prime concern and yet an oft-neglected area. This handbook fills this gap, providing theoretical and practical approaches to handling nutritional requirements of kidney patients. It provides information for patients of renal disease on what to eat and how to eat such that it slows down the progression of the disease, and provides lucid scientific answers to 'why what not to eat'. The author addresses a spectrum of kidney diseases and their nutritional management in the context to western and Indian/South Asian diet patterns, with many sample diet charts. In the chapter on counseling 'what bothers patients the most', she touches the deepest concerns of kidney patients and talks about the ways to attend them. The chapters 'Myths about Kidney Disease' and 'Nephrotoxic Drugs' caution on malpractices and misconceptions. The assessment section will help the readers evaluate their knowledge of the content, while the final section gives an overview of the basic concepts and information about the renal system, nutrients, and metabolism.  This handbook will aid nephrologists, physicians, and dieticians in providing better care and managing cases of malnutrition in renal diseases efficiently.
