"AIRPORT MARKETING (pb) 2013","In recent years, the airport sector has moved from an industry characterised by public sector ownership and national requirements, into a new era of airport management which is beginning to be dominated by the private sector and international players. Airports are now complex enterprises that require a wide range of business competencies and skills to meet the needs of their users, just as with any other industry. Moreover, deregulation of air transport markets has made the airport sector much more competitive and given airports greater incentives to develop innovative, proactive and aggressive marketing strategies so that they can reap the benefits from these developments. New types of airline business model, such as low cost carriers, have emerged through deregulation, which in many cases require a completely different approach to be adopted by airport marketers and have encouraged a further deviation from past practice. The travelling public is also becoming more experienced and is generally placing greater demands on the airport operator to deliver a quality product at a time when more stringent controls, especially as regards security, have been introduced.   This accessible book fills an important need for an up-to-date, comprehensive and in-depth textbook that introduces students and practitioners to the principles and practice of airport marketing as well as the major changes and future marketing challenges facing the airport sector. It applies principles of marketing within the airport industry, and examines airport marketing and its environment, how to define and measure the market for airport services, airport marketing planning, and individual elements of the airport marketing mix (product, price, promotion and distribution).

"MOVING BOXES BY AIR: THE ECONOMICS OF INTERATIONAL AIR CARGO (hb)2011","Air cargo is a key element of the global supply chain. It allows outsourcing of manufacturing to other countries and links production in both multinational and smaller enterprises. It has also been the most important driver of certain export industries in countries such as South Africa, Kenya and Chile. As a component of the air transport industry, air cargo makes the crucial difference between profit and loss on many long-haul routes. For some network combination carriers it accounts for up to half of total tonne-kms flown, and as much as one quarter of total revenue. In addition, the integrated carriers such as DHL, FedEx and TNT have their own fleets of dedicated freighter aircraft, and cargo aircraft operators like Cargolux and Nippon Cargo have a specialist role in the industry. Featuring expert analysis and worked examples to enhance understanding, Moving Boxes by Air by Peter Morrell offers a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to the business and practices of air cargo, with a chapter dedicated to each key issue, such as: current trends, market characteristics, regulation, airport terminal operations, pricing and revenues, and environmental impacts.

"PULSATION IN ARCHITECTURE (pb) 2011","This is a groundbreaking exploration of the new ways in which the built form can be envisioned through digital design. Pulsation in Architecture showcases the work of some of the world's leading designers at the forefront of the digital avant-garde. It reveals some of the most progressive, innovative concepts and fabrication techniques connected to the production of contemporary architecture design as well as cutting-edge technologies that are changing the way in which architecture is conceived and delivered. This state-of-the-art book will create a significant awareness of the power of digital design oriented to fabrication, as a trigger for change and innovation in architecture.  Pulsation in Architecture highlights the role of digital design as the catalyst for a new spatial sensibility related to rhythmic perception. It proposes a novel critical reception of computational architecture based on the ability of digital design to move beyond mere instrumentality, and to engage with core aspects of the discipline: the generative engine of digital architecture reinvigorates a discourse of part-to-whole relationships through the lens of rhythmic affect. There is a paradigm shift in spatial perception due to the intense use of computational techniques and the capacity to morph massive amounts of data in spatial patterns; rhythm plays a pivotal role in the articulation of the topology of buildings, generating the atmospheric character that induces moods and throbbing sensations in space. Pulsation introduces the fundamental animate capacity of living form and reshapes our perception of architectural space across the multiple scales of a project, from digital inception to fabrication. An emerging thread of rhythmic sensibility loosely binds a survey of contemporary design practices, including contributions by Peter Eisenman, Jeff Kipnis, Greg Lynn, UNStudio, Preston Scott Cohen, Reiser + Umemoto, Asymptote, Ali Rahim, Hernan Diaz Alonso, Ruy Klein, Gage / Clemenceau, NOX, Evan Douglis Studio, kokkugia, and MONAD Studio.

"PILE FOUNDATION DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION, 2e (pb) 2017","Pile foundation created a revolution ever since its inception in professional practices in seventies. But since that time, its design methods basically had been developed by different persons in their own way, either by common sense or by using laws of mechanics. This book is intended primarily to guide the readers on all aspects of pile foundation, though it is not easy to compile comprehensively in one volume. Since pile foundation is being used now on many projects, it is necessary to guide the engineering fraternity on its design in a simple way. Now piles, when provided in a series, serve as a retaining wall also. These are called soldier piles, secant piles or contiguous piles, and if soil nailing technique is not used for underground constructions, then contiguous piles provide a good substitute to sheet piles. Another offshoot to conventional RCC pile is stone column or granular pile. Pile foundation has proved its worth in all kinds of soils, including highly compressible soils. New development in pile foundation is the ‘spliced pile’ — which may be used where deep piles are required and could be made in precast pieces and joined at site in situ. Piles these days are being designed for uplift and lateral loads also. In this book efforts have been made to include all these details and surely it will prove to be a highly beneficial book to all readers.

"HYBRID SYSTEMS WITH CONSTRAINTS (hb)2013","Control theory is the main subject of this title, in particular analysis and control design for hybrid dynamic systems. The notion of hybrid systems offers a strong theoretical and unified framework to cope with the modeling, analysis and control design of systems where both continuous and discrete dynamics interact. The theory of hybrid systems has been the subject of intensive research over the last decade and a large number of diverse and challenging problems have been investigated. Nevertheless, many important mathematical problems remain open. This book is dedicated mainly to hybrid systems with constraints; taking constraints into account in a dynamic system description has always been a critical issue in control. New tools are provided here for stability analysis and control design for hybrid systems with operating constraints and performance specifications.  Contents  1.

"THE STEAM LOCOMOTIVE STORY (hb) 2017","Britain was the birthplace of the steam locomotive and even today, the world speed record for steam remains with a British locomotive, Mallard. The steam locomotive went through several distinct phases during its long life, which came to an end on regular service in the late 1960s. There was the early phase, then the trend for large single driving wheels, compound locomotives with connected driving wheels once steel became strong enough for the connecting rods, tanks engines that could run equally well forwards and backwards, the 4-6-0 and 4-6-2 expresses, the passion for speed records and streamlining, and then the standardization years of British Railways. Steam locomotives were even incorporated into railcars to improve the economics of branch lines. So significant was the steam locomotive that it gave its name to an era, the Steam Age.

"THE TRACTOR STORY (hb) 2017","More than 70 different tractors are shown in this photographic history, many in action and in many different countries. It traces their development from the first steam engines on wheels which used belts to drive farm machinery and developed into traction engines, used on farms by pulling a plough on cables between two engines. Moving into the 20th century, it discusses stationary internal combustion engines which began to be put on wheels and moved around a farm to drive threshing machines by belt. Firms like Allis-Chalmers, Benz, Lloyd, Jelbart, Glasgow, Fordson, Bates, and Hart-Parr are remembered, famous names which have faded away or been taken over. A few companies, such as Case and Massey, started in the middle of the 19th century and continue today on a global scale. John Deere started making ploughs in 1837 and is now the largest manufacturer in the world. Developments which have caused a giant leap forward are discussed, such as the use of rubber pneumatic tires rather than metal wheels, turbo-charged diesel engines, and the hydraulic three-point hitch system designed by Ferguson, which is still used today in some form on most modern machines.  About the Author  Duncan Wherrett is a professional photographer. Trevor Innes is the author of Tractor Heritage.","PKR 695.00","DUNCAN WHERRETT",9780752461984,2017,"ENGINEERING > AUTOMOBILE",,"Hard Cover",English,128,images/books/9780752461984.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780752461984&opt=3&sUBcAT=04

"REINFORCED PLASTICS HANDBOOK 3e(hb)2004","In this 3rd Edition of the Reinforced Plastics Handbook the authors have continued the approach of the late John Murphy, author of the first and second editions.The book provides a compendium of information on every aspect of materials, processes, designs and construction.Fiber-reinforced plastics are a class of materials in which the basic properties of plastics are given mechanical reinforcement by the addition of fibrous materials. The wide choice of plastics resin matrices and the correspondingly wide choice of reinforcing materials mean that the permutations are virtually unlimited. But the optimum properties of resin and reinforcement cannot be obtained unless there is an effective bond between the two, and this is the continuing objective of reinforced plastics production, design and processing.   · New 3rd edition of this comprehensive practical manual · This is a 'bible' for all those involved in the reinforced plastics industry, whether manufacturers, specifiers, designers or end-users. · Has been completely revised and updated to reflect all the latest developments in the industry","PKR 54,760.00","DONALD V.

"THERMAL SAFETY OF CHEMICAL PROCESSES (hb)2008","Based on the author's many years of experience in practicing safety assessment in industry and teaching students or professionals in this area, the topic of this book is seldom found on university curricula and many professionals do not have the knowledge required to interpret thermal data in terms of risks. For this reason, Francis Stoessel adopts a unique systematic how-to-do approach: Each chapter begins with a case history illustrating the topic and presenting the lessons learned from the incident. In so doing, he analyzes a goldmine of numerous examples stemming from industrial practice, additionally providing a series of problems or case studies at the end of each chapter. Divided into three distinct sections, part one looks at the general aspects of thermal process safety, while Part 2 deals with mastering exothermal reactions. The final section discusses the avoidance of secondary reactions, including heat accumulation and thermal confinement.

"ELECTRO VISCOELASTICITY: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS (hb)2010","In the 20 years since the pilot plant experiments used to develop the concept of electroviscoelasticity, inroads have been made in the understanding of its many related processes. Interfacial Electroviscoelasticity and Electrophoresis meets a massive scientific challenge by presenting deeper research and developments in the basic and applied science and engineering of finely dispersed particles and related systems.  Introducing more profound and in-depth treatises related to the liquid-liquid finely dispersed systems (i.e., emulsions and double emulsions), this book describes a new theory developed through the authors’ work. These findings are likely to impact other research and applications in a wide array of other fields, considering that the modeling of liquid-liquid interfaces is key to numerous chemical manufacturing processes, including those used for emulsions, suspensions, nanopowders, foams, biocolloids, and plasmas. The authors cover phenomena at the micro, nano, and atto-scales, and their techniques, theory, and supporting data will be of particular interest to nanoscientists, especially with regard to the breaking of emulsions. This groundbreaking book: Takes an interdisciplinary approach to elucidate the momentum transfer and electron transfer phenomena  Covers less classical chemical engineering insight and modern molecular and atomic engineering  Reviews basic theory of electrokinetics, using the electrophoresis of rigid particles as an example  Built around the central themes of hydrodynamic, electrodynamic, and thermodynamic instabilities that occur at interfaces, this book addresses recently developed concepts in the physics, chemistry, and rheological properties of those well-studied interfaces of rigid and deformable particles in homo- and hetero-aggregate dispersed systems. The book also introduces the key phenomenon of electrophoresis, since it is widely adopted either as an analytical tool to characterize the surface properties of colloid-sized particles or in the separation and purification process of both laboratory and industrial scales. The applications and implications of the material presented in the book represent a major contribution to the advanced fundamental, applied, and engineering research of interfacial and colloidal phenomena.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE FOR METAL REMOVAL FROM TEXTILE WASTEWATER (pb) 2012","Industrial wastewater contains many pollutants. This book focuses on heavy metals found in textile effluents because of their known toxicity effect in the environment. Wastewater from a textile industry (UTEXRWA) in Rwanda has been screened for the occurrence of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Batch and pilot experiments on adsorption equilibrium, kinetics, and sulfide precipitation using volcanic rock as adsorbent and packing material have been investigated. A low cost and integrated system for treatment has been developed, combining an anaerobic bioreactor as the main treatment step, followed by a polishing step composed by a polishing pond containing algae, duckweed, and water hyacinth. More than 90% of metal removal was achieved in the bioreactor, with metal sulfide precipitation as long-term removal mechanism. The use of algae and duckweed as alternatives for water hyacinth plants showed no differences between algae and duckweed ponds based on abiotic differences. Overall, both systems' performance was close and these systems are well suited as a polishing step for wastewater containing low metal concentrations. The integrated system for heavy metal removal showed how two complementary systems for heavy metal removal can work in combination and good removal performance can therefore be achieved.

"ELECTROCHEMICAL ENERGY STORAGE FOR RENEWABLE SOURCE AND GRID BALANCING (hb) 2014","Key Features  •Provides state-of-the-art information on all of the storage systems together with an assessment of competing technologies •Features detailed technical, economic and environmental impact information of different storage systems •Contains information about the challenges that must be faced for batteries and hydrogen-storage to be used in conjunction with a fluctuating (renewable energy) power supply  Description :  Electricity from renewable sources of energy is plagued by fluctuations (due to variations in wind strength or the intensity of insolation) resulting in a lack of stability if the energy supplied from such sources is used in ‘real time’. An important solution to this problem is to store the energy electrochemically (in a secondary battery or in hydrogen and its derivatives) and to make use of it in a controlled fashion at some time after it has been initially gathered and stored. Electrochemical battery storage systems are the major technologies for decentralized storage systems and hydrogen is the only solution for long-term storage systems to provide energy during extended periods of low wind speeds or solar insolation. Future electricity grid design has to include storage systems as a major component for grid stability and for security of supply. The technology of systems designed to achieve this regulation of the supply of renewable energy, and a survey of the markets that they will serve, is the subject of this book. It includes economic aspects to guide the development of technology in the right direction.   Author: Patrick T. Moseley  Patrick Moseley PhD DSc graduated from the University of Durham, England. He worked for 23 years at the UK Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, where he brought a background of crystal structure and materials chemistry to the study of lead-acid and other types of battery, thus supplementing the traditional electrochemical emphasis of the subject, and to the study of sensor materials.

"RIVER RESTORATION: MANAGING THE UNCERTAINTY IN RESTORING PHYSICAL HABITAT (hb)2008","River restoration projects are designed to recreate functional characteristics within a context of physical stability. They tend to focus on the development and application of geomorphic principles for river restoration design. Due to different models obtaining different results on the same problem, incomplete or absent data, and climatic/social/cultural changes, the designers and managers of such projects frequently face high levels of uncertainty. This book will provide a systematic overview of the issues involved in minimizing and coping with uncertainty in river restoration projects. A series of thematic sections will be used to define the various sources of uncertainty in restoration projects and how these show at different points in the life cycle (design, construction and post-construction phases) of restoration projects. The structure of the book will offer a rational theoretical analysis of the problem while providing practical guidance in managing the different sources of uncertainty.

"TRAFFIC AND HIGHWAY ENGINEERING 4e (hb) 2008","The new edition of Garber and Hoel's best-selling text focuses on giving students insight into all facets of traffic and highway engineering. Students generally come to this course with little knowledge or understanding of the importance of transportation, much less of the extensive career opportunities within the field. Transportation is an extremely broad field, and courses must either cover all transportation modes or focus on specifics. While many topics can be covered with a survey approach, this often lacks sufficient depth and students leave the course without a full understanding of any of the fields. This text focuses exclusively on traffic and highway engineering beginning with a discussion of the pivotal role transportation plays in our society, including employment opportunities, historical impact, and the impact of transportation on our daily lives. This approach gives students a sense of what the field is about as well as an opportunity to consider some of its challenges. Later chapters focus on specific issues facing transportation engineers. The text uses pedagogical tools such as worked problems, diagrams and tables, reference material, and realistic examples to demonstrate how the material is applied.  About the Author Nicholas J. Garber is a Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Virginia where he has been a member of the faculty since September of 1980. Before joining the University of Virginia, Dr. Garber was a Professor of Civil Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Sierra Leone, where he was also the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering. At the State University of New York at Buffalo, he played an important role in the development of the graduate program in Transportation Engineering. For several years, he was a design engineer for consulting engineering firms in London, and also worked as an Area Engineer and Assistant Resident Engineer in Sierra Leone.  Lester A. Hoel is the L.A. Lacy Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Engineering and the Director of the Center for Transportation Studies at the University of Virginia. He held the Hamilton Professorship in Civil Engineering from 1974-99. From 1974-89 he was Chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering. Previously he was Professor of Civil Engineering and Associate Director, Transportation Research Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and on the faculty at San Diego State University.

"LEGAL ASPECTS OF ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS 9e (hb) 2012","The primary focus of this text is to provide a bridge for students between the academic world and the real world. This bridge is built through an understanding of what is law, how law is created, how law affects almost every activity of human conduct, and how legal institutions operate. Intended mainly for architectural and engineering students, but increasingly for those in business schools and law schools, this text features a clear, concise, and jargon-free presentation. It probes beneath the surface of legal rules and uncovers why these rules developed as they did, outlines arguments for and against these rules, and examines how they work in practice. Updated with the most recent developments in the legal aspects of architectural, engineering, and the construction processes, this text is also a valuable reference for practitioners and has been cited in over twenty-five court decisions.

"STRUCTURAL DESIGN IN BUILDING CONSERVATION (hb)2012","No building is properly conserved if it is not structurally sound. Consequently architects, engineers and conservation officers need an adequate grounding in the technology as well as in the materials and the historic origins of the building.  Structural interventions to historic buildings are however an integral part of the effort to select and update their design, historic and cultural values. Structural Design in Building Conservation deals with such design issues and shows how technical choices integrate with the planning and architectural outcomes in a conservation project. It brings together theory with current conservation technology, discussing the possibilities of structural details and strategies in architectural expression and is particularly directed at students of architectural conservation technology and practising engineers and architects.  Central to this outline is the discussion of case studies, which is organised around themes like addition of roofs, requalification of space, strengthening and re-use of fabric, repristination, additions, completions, stiffness adjustments, correction of past mistakes etc. and the reader is encouraged to appraise directly the solutions.  The book introduces the philosophy of structural interventions within the range of conservation theories and discusses practices in various European countries. It then outlines the main types of strengthening, repairs and interventions in terms of building types and the structural nature of the main elements to be strengthened (linear structures, frames, plates and shells). Significant case studies are presented that cover a very wide range of historic types and conversions, not only monumental masonry structures like neoclassic buildings, major temples, churches, public buildings, and museums, but also more utilitarian structures like historic mills, early reinforced concrete structures and vaulting types.

"PERFORMANCE BASED BUILDINGDESIGN 2 (pb)2012","Just like building physics, performance based building design was hardly an issue before the energy crises of the 1970ies. With the need to upgrade energy efficiency, the interest in overall building performance grew. This work published in two volumes, applies the performance rationale, advanced in applied building physics, to the design and construction of buildings. In continuation of Vol. 1 this volume discusses light-weight construction with wooden and metal elements, roofing systems, façades, and ends with finishes and the overall risk analysis. Most chapters build on a same scheme: overview, overall performance evaluation, design and construction. This fourth book, after Building Physics and Applied Building Physics, is the result of 38 years of teaching architectural, building and civil engineers, coupled to more than 40 years of experience in research and consultancy. Where and when needed, input and literature from over the world was used, reason why each chapter ends listing references and literature. The book should be usable by undergraduates and graduates in architectural and building engineering, though also building engineers, who want to refresh their knowledge, may benefit. The level of discussion assumes the reader has a sound knowledge of building physics, along with a background in structural engineering, building materials and building construction.

"FRP DECK AND STEEL GIRDER BRIDGE SYSTEMS (pb) 2013","Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) decks have been increasingly used for new construction and rehabilitation projects worldwide. The benefits of using FRP bridge decks, such as durability, light weight, high strength, reduced maintenance costs, and rapid installation, outweigh their initial in-place material costs when implemented in highway bridge projects. FRP Deck and Steel Girder Bridge Systems: Analysis and Design compiles the necessary information to facilitate the development of the standards and guidelines needed to promote further adoption of composite sandwich panels in construction. It also, for the first time, proposes a complete set of design guidelines. Providing both experimental investigations and theoretical analyses, this book covers three complementary parts: FRP decks, shear connectors between the deck and steel girders, and the behavior of bridge systems. The text presents stiffness and strength evaluations for FRP deck panels and FRP deck-girder bridge systems. While the FRP deck studies focus on honeycomb FPR sandwich panels over steel girder bridge systems, they can be adapted to other sandwich configurations. Similarly, the shear connection and bridge system studies can be applied to other types of FRP decks. Chapters discuss skin effect, core configuration, facesheet laminates, out-of-plane compression and sheer, mechanical shear connectors, and FRP deck–steel girder bridge systems. Based on the findings described in the text, the authors propose design guidelines and present design examples to illustrate application of the guidelines. In the final chapter, they also provide a systematic analysis and design approach for single-span FRP deck-stringer bridges. This book presents new and improved theories and combines analytical models, numerical analyses, and experimental investigations to devise a practical analysis procedure, resulting in FRP deck design formulations.

"BUILDING SERVICES DESIGN FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT BUILDINGS (pb) 2013","The role and influence of building services engineers is undergoing rapid change and is pivotal to achieving low-carbon buildings. However, textbooks in the field have largely focused on the detailed technicalities of HVAC systems, often with little wider context. This book addresses that need by embracing a contemporary understanding of energy efficiency imperatives, together with a strategic approach to the key design issues impacting upon carbon performance, in a concise manner.  The key conceptual design issues for planning the principal systems that influence energy efficiency are examined in detail. In addition, the following issues are addressed in turn: - Background issues for sustainability and the design process  - Developing a strategic approach to energy-efficient design  - How to undertake load assessments  - System comparison and selection  - Space planning for services - Post-occupancy evaluation of completed building services  In order to deliver sustainable buildings, a new perspective is needed amongst building and services engineering designers, from the outset of the conceptual design stage and throughout the whole design process. In this book, students and practitioners alike will find the ideal introduction to this new approach.  Author Paul Tymkow is Director of Learning and Knowledge at Hoare Lea.

"RETROFITTING THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT(hb)2013","The physical upgrading of the existing domestic and industrial building stock to improve energy performance is an essential part of a transition to a low carbon society. Successfully retrofitting buildings to improve energy performance is not simply a technological challenge, it is a complex socio-technical problem that needs to be addressed in a co-ordinated way, utilising skills and knowledge from a range of industrial and academic backgrounds.  Within both the academic and practitioner communities there is a growing understanding of the scale and nature of the problem, one which encompasses issues such as policy and regulation, people and behaviour, supply chain and process, as well as issues of technology. Retrofitting the Built Environment discusses the factors that impact on the retrofit problem, providing a clear analysis of the main issues that the academic and industrial communities must engage with to resolve the problems of domestic energy and retrofit. The book is divided into four broad sections:  •Understanding the Problem •Policy and Regulation •Implementing and Evaluating Retrofit •People and Communities   Academic and industrial researchers, policy makers and industry practitioners will find each section covers a mix of policy, technical and social science issues, presented by both academic and industry authors, giving a wide and detailed perspective of the issue.  The Editors Will Swan is a Senior Lecturer in Buildings Retrofit in the School of the Built Environment at the University of Salford. He leads a number of projects in the field of sustainable retrofit, covering a number of topics including monitoring, behaviour and retrofit project delivery, as part of Salford’s Applied Energy and Buildings Research Group. He sits on the Greater Manchester Buildings Group and also is Chair of the Retrofit Innovation Group.  Philip Brown is Director and Senior Research Fellow at the Salford Housing & Urban Studies Unit (SHUSU) at the University of Salford.

"CONCRETE CONSTRUCTIONS FOR WIND TURBINES (pb)2013","The wind energy industry in Germany has an excellent global standing when it comes to the development and construction of wind turbines. Germany currently represents the world's largest market for wind energy. The ongoing development of ever more powerful wind turbines plus additional requirements for the design and construction of their offshore foundation structures exceeds the actual experiences gained so far in the various disciplines concerned. This book gives a comprehensive overview for planning and structural design analysis of reinforced concrete and pre-stressed concrete wind turbine towers for both, onshore and offshore wind turbines. Wind turbines represent structures subjected to highly dynamic loading patterns. Therefore, for the design of loadbearing structures, fatigue effects - and not just maximum loads - are extremely important, in particular in the connections and joints of concrete and hybrid structures. There multi-axial stress conditions occure which so far are not covered by the design codes. The specific actions, the nonlinear behaviour and modeling for the structural analysis are explained. Design and verification with a focus on fatigue are adressed. The chapter Manufacturing includes hybrid structures, segmental construction of pre-stressed concrete towers and offshore wind turbine foundations.

"EARTH ANCHORS 2e (hb)2014","Anchors are primarily used in the construction of foundations of earth-supported and earth-retaining structures. The fundamental reason for using earth anchors in construction is to transmit the outwardly directed load to the soil at a greater depth and/or farther away from the structure. Although earth anchors have been used in practice for several hundred years, proper theoretical developments for purposes of modern engineering designs have taken place only during the past 40 to 45 years. This book summarizes most theoretical and experimental works directed toward the development of proper relationships for ultimate and allowable holding capacity of earth anchors.

"DEEPWATER FOUNDATIONS AND PIPELINE GEOMECHANICS (hb)","Practicing engineers in the offshore engineering industry will find in this contributed handbook practical information on current oil field production development practices for foundations and subsea flowlines. The technical challenges associated with deepwater developments have led to significant innovations. The contributors are practicing engineers and academics who have been at the forefront of offshore geotechnic development for several decades. Until the 1980s, the most common design concerns for offshore foundation and pipeline engineering were associated with extreme storm loadings, earthquakes, mudflows, fatigue, and installation activities. Engineers today face additional concerns, including: submarine slope failures, thermal buckling of pipelines, catenary riser interaction with the seafloor, vortex induced vibration of flowlines, shallow water flows encountered during drilling operations, and thermal interaction of pipelines with permafrost. This handbook describes recent advances in geophysical data acquisition and evaluation as they relate to offshore developments, as well as foundation and pipeline design considerations.

"SEMI-RIGID CONNECTIONS HANDBOOK, 1e (hb) 2014","Research on the topic of steel frames with semi-rigid connections (Partially Restrained (PR) construction or PR connection) has been conducted over the past 10 years. Despite significant research and development efforts, usage of PR principles has nevertheless been very slow in coming to the profession caused in part by the lack of easy access to reliable test data on these connections and also due to the lack of software for practical implementation. With the publication of the 2005 AISC specifications as well as Eurocode 3, practical implementation of the use of PR connections in structural systems is now a real possibility. This Handbook presents a simple and comprehensive introduction that will help design practitioners implement these new developments into engineering practice. Beginning with a discussion of the new specifications and classifications of these connections, the authors go on to show, on the basis of the collected connections database, practical mathematical models for computer implementation, and provide case studies on these frames including composite construction. With the help of the user-friendly list of collected data in tabular form with illustrative figures, information on semi-rigid connections is now available in a single publication and may ultimately result in its wide-spread usage among practitioners.  Features •Introduces the 2005 AISC specifications and the new Eurocode 3 on semi-rigid construction •Includes more than 900 semi-rigid connection test data in tabular form with figures •Provides connection models for analysis and design with case studies •Includes the recent development of steel-concrete composite connections with case studies  About the Author Dr. Wai-Fah   Dr. Wai-Fah Chen was Professor and Dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Hawaii from 1999 to 2006.

"REINFORCED CONCRETE STRUCTURES 5e(pb)2016","The methods in design of reinforced concrete are changing as the technology is progressing; consequently the codes of practice have to be updated frequently when compared with the other methods of construction, The Indian Code of practice on Plain and Reinforces Concrete, IS 456 that is considered to be mother code for design and construction of concrete structures has gone through the fourth revision and now being implemented in India. The revised edition of the book is based on the revised code of practice, IS: 456-2000. The section on. the durability of concrete structures is expanded considering the latest trends in the durability-based design of concrete structures and the code specifications. A section on quality assurance in concrete structures is added incorporating the acceptability criteria of concrete as per the revised code of practice. A brief note on Nondestructive Testing of Concrete Structures is included considering the latest technology in quality control. The Limit State Design of concrete structures was originally introduced in Indian practice in 1978 along with Working Stress Design method. However the present revision of the code has given more importance to the Limit State Design. The book therefore covers the limit state design method extensively with a number of examples. Reinforcement detailing is another important aspect, which often neglected leading to poor quality and reduced life of the structures. All examples are accompanied by illustrative drawings giving a depth to the understanding of the subject. The chapters on yield line theory of slabs, design of reservoirs and overhead water tanks, and design of shallow and deep foundations are given special treatment considering the needs of the consulting and practicing engineers. The chapter on miscellaneous structures covers some unusual designs not normally available in many books. The author has incorporated his vast experience in teaching and wide consulting practice in the book with practical applications. The book is intended as a textbook for Civil Engineering students and a reference book for practicing engineers.

"BENTONITE HANDBOOK: LUBRICATION FOR PIPE JACKING (pb) 2017","Pipe jacking is a construction process for the no-dig laying of pipes. Successful pipe jacking demands low skin friction between the ground and the jacked pipe. This is achieved with bentonite lubrication. The bentonite slurry fed into the annular gap fulfils several purposes. It stabilises the annular gap by supporting the surrounding ground and reduces friction contact between ground and jacked pipe. The Bentonite Handbook deals comprehensibly with the relevant aspects of annular gap lubrication: starting with the ground conditions, which are of decisive importance for lubrication, through the rheological properties of the bentonite slurry to the technical components of lubrication technology and lubrication strategy. The use of standardised measuring apparatus is described as well as mixing equipment and the automatic lubrication system. Overview tables with calculations and suggested values for bentonite consumption quantities depending on the prevailing ground conditions and the pipe jacking parameters complete the recommendations  About the Author Steffen Praetorius is a graduate geologist and deputy manager of research and development in the Utility Tunnelling department of Herrenknecht AG. In addition to research projects and geotechnical considerations, his duties also include technical and user-specific questions about the use of bentonite in tunnelling.

"CONCRETE SURFACE ENGINEERING (pb)2017","Applying any material to an existing concrete surface intrinsically entails the development of a bond. Considering the ever increasing importance of concrete repair and protection, which imply the creation of an interface between two materials, an improved knowledge of concrete surface characteristics is paramount.  Surface engineering, which has evolved from the world of metallurgy, addresses all surface-related considerations, notably adhesion. It provides a fundamental understanding of what will make the contact between two materials effective or not, allowing for interactions of variable intensity.

"NUMERICAL SIMULATION IN HYDRAULIC FRACTURING: MULTIPHYSICS THEORY AND APPLICATIONS (hb) 2017","The expansion of unconventional petroleum resources in the recent decade and the rapid development of computational technology have provided the opportunity to develop and apply 3D numerical modeling technology to simulate the hydraulic fracturing of shale and tight sand formations. This book presents 3D numerical modeling technologies for hydraulic fracturing developed in recent years, and introduces solutions to various 3D geomechanical problems related to hydraulic fracturing. In the solution processes of the case studies included in the book, fully coupled multi-physics modeling has been adopted, along with innovative computational techniques, such as submodeling.  In practice, hydraulic fracturing is an essential project component in shale gas/oil development and tight sand oil, and provides an essential measure in the process of drilling cuttings reinjection (CRI). It is also an essential measure for widened mud weight window (MWW) when drilling through naturally fractured formations; the process of hydraulic plugging is a typical application of hydraulic fracturing. 3D modeling and numerical analysis of hydraulic fracturing is essential for the successful development of tight oil/gas formations: it provides accurate solutions for optimized stage intervals in a multistage fracking job. It also provides optimized well-spacing for the design of zipper-frac wells. Numerical estimation of casing integrity under stimulation injection in the hydraulic fracturing process is one of major concerns in the successful development of unconventional resources. This topic is also investigated numerically in this book. Numerical solutions to several other typical geomechanics problems related to hydraulic fracturing, such as fluid migration caused by fault reactivation and seismic activities, are also presented.  This book can be used as a reference textbook to petroleum, geotechnical and geothermal engineers, to senior undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, and to geologists, hydrogeologists, geophysicists and applied mathematicians working in this field. This book is also a synthetic compendium of both the fundamentals and some of the most advanced aspects of hydraulic fracturing technology.  Features Presents innovative examples and typical applications of multiphysics phenomena. Practical, detailed explanations are provided for the modeling process of each application example included in the book. Provides detailed mechanical analyses with innovative 3D numerical techniques.  Provides the mathematical modeling of the natural fracture in a shale formation, and further models it in the framework of Continuum Damage Mechanics.  Introduces the mathematical theory and the flowchart which is used in development of the software toolset, providing a primary foundation for proper development of related data processors.

"FLUVIAL PROCESSES 2e (hb) 2017","Features •Providing a comprehensive review of key topics in river morphodynamics •Presenting a unified treatment of the subject, supported by the most recent findings on related fields, such as, for example, large-scale turbulence •Each chapter is supplemented by a set of related problems •Special attention is paid to the translation of research findings into equations and methods for application in river engineering practice Summary A stream flowing in alluvium deforms its bed surface, forming ripples, dunes, bars, etc., and, in many instances, it deforms its channel entirely, thereby creating meandering or braiding patterns. It could be said that, in general, an alluvial stream and its deformable boundary undergo a variety of fluvial processes leading to the emergence of a multitude of alluvial forms.  This book concerns the physics and analytical treatment of various fluvial processes and the associated alluvial bed and plan forms listed above. Following an introductory chapter on the basics of turbulent flow and sediment transport, the book covers the origin, geometric characteristics and effects of bed forms, from small- to meso-scale (ripples, dunes, alternate and multiple bars); the initiation, geometry and mechanics of meandering streams; the computation of flow, bed deformation and the planimetric evolution of meandering streams; and braiding and delta formation. The book also covers the regime concept, the time-development of a stream towards its regime state, and the formulation of stable, or equilibrium, morphology. The book distinguishes itself by its comprehensive analysis and discussion of key processes involved in large-scale river morphodynamics.   The book was written primarily for researchers and graduate students of hydraulic engineering, water resources and related branches of earth sciences, but it will also prove useful for river engineers and managers.

"ENGINEERING OF GLACIAL DEPOSITS (hb) 2017","At some time 30% of the world’s land mass was covered by glaciers leaving substantial deposits of glacial soils under major conurbations in Europe, North and South America, New Zealand, Europe and Russia. For instance, 60% of the UK has been affected, leaving significant glacial deposits under major conurbations where two thirds of the population live.  Glacial soils are composite soils with significant variations in composition and properties and are recognised as challenging soils to deal with. Understanding the environment in which they were formed and how this affects their behaviour are critical because they do not always conform to classic theories of soil mechanics. This book is aimed at designers and contractors working in the construction and extractive industries to help them mitigate construction hazards on, with or in glacial deposits. These soils increase risks to critical infrastructure which, in the UK includes the majority of the road and rail network, coastal defences such as the fastest eroding coastline in Europe and most of the water supply reservoirs. It brings together many years of experience of research into the behaviour of glacial deposits drawing upon published and unpublished case studies from industry. It draws on recent developments in understanding of the geological processes and the impact they have upon the engineering properties, construction processes and performance of geotechnical structures. Unlike other books on glaciation it brings together all the relevant disciplines in earth sciences and engineering to make it directly relevant to the construction industry.  Features Draws on the author's extensive practical experience. Makes use of published and unpublished case studies and research data. Uses recent developments in the understanding of glacial environments to help explain the behaviour of the glacial deposits and how they affect the construction processes and performance of geotechnical structures.

The advantages and limitations of the tests are described for measuring the desired property, and engineers can specify a test according to the material’s use.  The book starts with a resume of specifications and their relative advantages and disadvantages for different situations. Then different properties are discussed in terms of: their specification; the test methods that can be used (primarily the EN 12697 suite of European methods, of which the author has been responsible for drafting); the extent to which the results predict performance; the levels that can be achieved with different asphalt mixes and types; what levels, if any, should be specified in various situations and pavement layers; and which other properties are adversely affected by enhanced performance. The final section covers various aspects of sustainability, with a strong emphasis on durability.

"ALKALI-AGGREGATE REACTION IN CONCRETE (hb) 2017","Features •This is a new and unique country-by-country global review of the problems caused by alkali-aggregate reaction in concrete •Its contributors are internationally recognised experts from all the relevant regions round the world •An essential primary reference for those professionals concerned with the premature deterioration of and damage to concrete structures •An essential reference source for technical investigations and legal disputes concerning concrete in any country in the world. •Extensively produced in full colour, with case study illustrations given for each country •Extensive up-to-date reference list for each chapter. Summary Alkali-Aggregate Reaction in Concrete: A World Review is unique in providing authoritative and up to date expert information on the causes and effects of Alkali-Aggregate Reaction (AAR) in concrete structures worldwide. In 1992 a first edition entitled The Alkali-Silica Reaction in Concrete, edited by Professor Narayan Swamy, was published in a first attempt to cover this concrete problem from a global perspective, but the coverage was incomplete. This completely new edition offers a fully updated and more universal coverage of the world situation concerning AAR and includes a wealth of new evidence and research information that has accumulated in the intervening years. Although there are various textbooks offering readers sections that deal with AAR deterioration and damage to concrete, no other single book brings together the views of recognised international experts in the field, and the wealth of scattered research information that is available. It provides a ‘state of the art’ review and deals authoritatively with the mechanisms of AAR, its diagnosis and how to treat concrete affected by AAR. It is illustrated by numerous actual examples from around the world, and comprises specialist contributions provided by senior engineers and scientists from many parts of the world.  The book is divided into two distinct but complementary parts. The first five chapters deal with the most recent findings concerning the mechanisms involved in the reaction, methods concerning its diagnosis, testing and evaluation, together with an appraisal of current methods used in its avoidance and in the remediation of affected concrete structures. The second part is divided into eleven chapters covering each region of the world in turn. These chapters have been written by experts with specialist knowledge of AAR in the countries involved and include an authoritative appraisal of the problem and its solution as it affects concrete structures in the region.  Such an authoritative compilation of information on AAR has not been attempted previously on this scale and this work is therefore an essential source for practising and research civil engineers, consultant engineers and materials scientists, as well as aggregate and cement producers, designers and concrete suppliers, especially regarding projects outside their own region.  Editor(s) Bio Dr Ian Sims is a Director of RSK Environment Ltd in the UK, where he is responsible for Materials Consultancy and Expert Witness Services. He graduated in geology at London University in 1972 and then undertook research in concrete technology, including AAR in the British Isles, being awarded a PhD in 1977. Ian joined Sandberg LLP in 1975 and gained wide experience with construction geomaterials. In 1996, he moved to STATS Limited, which joined RSK Group PLC in 2008.

"BETON KALENDER: BALLASTLESS TRACKS (pb)","Due to increasing traffic flows the extension of transport infrastructure with rail roads and high speed lines is an ongoing process worldwide. Ballastless track systems with concrete slabs are used more and more. Following the first trials in the 1970s and more than four decades of R&D work on ballastless track, the level of development is such that it can be confirmed that ballastless track is suitable for use as an alternative to ballasted track. This book makes a contribution to the state of the art of ballastless track by describing the basics for designing the ballastless track. Important advice is provided regarding the construction of ballastless track on earthworks and in tunnels. There is also a description of the technical history of the development of ballastless track on bridges and the ensuing findings for bridge design. The state of the art of ballastless track for switches, important information on details concerning drainage, transitions, accessibility for road vehicles and experience gleaned from maintenance round off the work.

"PRACTICAL GEOMETRY AND GRAPHICS 8e(pb) 1989","THIS BOOK IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COURSE IN PRACTICAL Geometry for engineering students who have already received some instruction in elementary plane geometry, graph plotting, and the use T of vectors. It also covers the requirements of Secondary School pupils taking Practical Geometry at the Advanced Level. The grouping adopted, in which Plane Geometry is dealt with in Part I, and Solid or Descriptive Geometry in Part II, is artificial, and it is the intention that the two parts should be read concurrently. The logical treatment of the subject presents many difficulties and the sequence of the later chapters in both parts is necessarily a compromise; as an illustration, certain of the more easy inter­ sections and developments might with advantage be taken at an earlier stage than that indicated. In Part I considerable space has been devoted to Engineering Graphics, particularly to the applications of graphical integration. The use of graphical methods of computation is fully justified in most engineering problems of a practical nature-especially where analytical methods would prove laborious -the results obtained being as accurate as the data warrant.

"ENGINEERING GRAPHICS AND DESIGN: WITH DEMONSTRATIONS OF AUTOCAD,CATIA AND ANSYS (pb) 2018","This book is developed from the ground up to cover the syllabus announced by the AICTE in its latest model curriculum. It provides insights into traditional engineering graphics as well as treats of the subject using software AutoCAD, CATIA and ANSYS, through simple and well-explained examples along with an ample number of unsolved problems and MCQs. Screenshots have been provided after every step, making it simple to learn how to use the software for a specific solution. It targets all academics—students, and researchers as well as industry practitioners and engineers, involved in engineering drafting.  The book begins by introducing the role and application of engineering drawing and describing such basics as the types of drawing sheets, lines, planes, quadrants and angles of projection, and national and international drawing standards which it calls the basic grammar for engineering graphics as a language.  The book introduces the software—AutoCAD, CATIA and ANSYS emphasizing on their specific features. Equipping the reader with this ground knowledge it comes to the nitty-gritty of drawing various curves, projection of points in separate quadrants, projection of straight lines in various positions, various projections of plane surfaces, and solids like prism, pyramid, cylinder and cone. It then goes further to sections of solids wherein the placements of the cutting planes have been explained in various positions like perpendicular, parallel, and inclined to HP and VP. Having thus trained the drafter in handling the drafting tools the book graduates to more complicated material like fusion of one solid shape into another. It explores various types of them so that development of lateral surfaces of solids can be made and depicted isometrically and projected orthographically. Lastly, the book describes 3D modelling using CATIA, where solid models are drawn, and how 2D analysis is done using ANSYS.  KEY FEATURES  Keeping in view the traditional engineering drawing principles, the book extensively deals with computer-based engineering graphics • Introduces all the relevant drawing standards, both Indian and International • Extensively covers points, lines, planes, solid surfaces and all the salient projections • Plenty of usage/demos of AutoCAD and Catia for solid or 3D modelling, and Ansys for 2D analysis • Holds the hands of the students to introduce the above-said software with all their functionalities before moving on to applications • Step-by-step treatment of all software methods using series of well-labelled screenshots • A companion video of various exercises that provides a visual display of the problems being solved, and shows how to utilize various tools and utilities of the software used  Authors: Kaushik Kumar, Apurba Kumar Roy & Chikesh Ranjan","PKR 681.00","KAUSHIK KUMAR",9789352718726,2018,"ENGINEERING > DESIGN & GRAPHIC ART",1,Paperback,English,440,images/books/9789352718726.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9789352718726&opt=3&sUBcAT=04

In Experimental Researches in Electricity, first published in three volumes between 1839 and 1855, Faraday discusses the inquiries that led to his development of the first dynamo (the precursor of modern dynamos and generators), and his establishment of the foundations of classical field theory. His descriptions contain scarcely a hint of mathematics, and he relates the progress of his experiments in direct, clear language. Using the primitive tools available to him in his time, in conjunction with his great imaginative gifts, Faraday explains how he arrived at his profound conclusions with stunning simplicity.

"ELECTRICITY WAYLEAVES, EASEMENTS AND CONSENTS: LITIGATION, PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE (pb)2007","Electricity is such a fundamental part of life that its supply is often taken for granted. However the reality is that the rights for electricity lines are arguably the weakest of all utilities, with the vast majority covered by Wayleaves. The rights to run electricity lines across private land needs to be properly investigated and qualified. Large areas of land already are restricted by electricity lines, and the Government's plans for substantial new house building, will create a great deal of interest in this area. Therefore the need for well-informed and experienced advice for landowners has never been more critical. There are few experienced practitioners in this field, but there are many new entrants pushing up fees and often providing inappropriate advice. The first book of its type, it brings together both legal and surveying experience, reviews all the relevant law and practice in one place, and provides key insight into: (i) Defining electricity Wayleave, (ii) Handling the relevant statutory and Lands Tribunal procedures and (iii) Valuation of Wayleaves. Case studies are used to illustrate the relevant rules and legislation, allowing non-specialists to give a considered opinion to clients on action to take to avoid uncertainty for all involved.   About the Author Charles Hamer is a chartered surveyor and managing director of Hamer Associates Ltd, the country's leading specialist electricity wayleave consultancy. Prior to that Charles spent 28 years within the electricity industry in various senior valuation and property roles.  Gary O'Brien qualified as a solicitor in 1985 is a partner in the real estate litigation group at the national law firm, Eversheds LLP. He specialises in all disputes arising out of acquisition, disposal, development and letting of commercial property, the resolution of boundary and easement problems and other site assembly issues that can impact on residential development.

"INTRODUCTION TO ANALOG AND DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS 2e (hb) 2007","Communications, 2e and the forthcoming revision of his classic Communications Systems, 5e. The second edition of Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e is written at an accessible level and serves as an introductory treatment of communication theory, both ana-log and digital communications. Given the highly mathematical nature of communication theory, it is rather easy for the reader to lose sight of the practical side of communication systems. Throughout the book, the authors have made a special effort to move through the mathe-matical treatment at an easy-to-grasp level, and also to point out the practical relevance of the theory wherever it is appropri-ate to do so.  Drs. Haykin’s other text, Communication Systems reaches out to a higher level of math rigor. Also, Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e offers the probability coverage later in the book (chapter 8) since probability theory is not critical to the understanding of modulation. This also contributes to the accessible approach of the text. Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e is self-contained and suited for a one or two-semester course in communica-tion systems taken by Electrical Engineering juniors or seniors. The book offers flexibility for organizing the course material to suit the interests of course professors and students.  Reviewer Quotes: My current textbook by Proakis/Salehi: Communication Systems Engineering, 2e did not meet my student’s capabilities and expecta-tions. The textbook is too complicated and overloaded with heavy mathematical equations. The material is not always logically presented. Not to mention, there is 800 pages of text. I was impressed with Haykin/Moher’s: Introduction to Digital and Analog Communications, 2e and the straightforward comprehensive material coverage of the basic principles of communication theory. Also, the text is logically written with easy to follow and understand mathematical equations and examples.

Nanoparticle technology plays an important role in the implementation of nanotechnology in many engineering and industrial fields including electronic devices, advanced ceramics, new batteries, engineered catalysts, functional paint and ink, Drug Delivery System, biotechnology, etc.; and makes use of the unique properties of the nanoparticles which are completely different from those of the bulk materials. This new handbook is the first to explain complete aspects of nanoparticles with many application examples showing their advantages and advanced development. There are handbooks which briefly mention the nanosized particles or their related applications, but no handbook describing the complete aspects of nanoparticles has been published so far. The handbook elucidates of the basic properties of nanoparticles and various nanostructural materials with their characterisation methods in the first part. It also introduces more than 40 examples of practical and potential uses of nanoparticles in the later part dealing with applications. It is intended to give readers a clear picture of nanoparticles as well as new ideas or hints on their applications to create new materials or to improve the performance of the advanced functional materials developed with the nanoparticles.

"VALUING WIND GENERATION ON INTEGRATED POWER SYSTEMS (hb)2010","Wind powered generation is the fastest growing energy source in the United States due to a combination of economic incentives, public preference for renewable energy as expressed in government policies, competitive costs, and the need to address global warming. The economic consequences of the relative variability and lower predictability of wind generation are not easily captured in standard economic analyses performed by utility planners. This book provides utility analysts and regulators a guide to analyzing the value of wind generation in the context of modern power systems.  Guiding the reader through the steps to understanding and valuing wind generation on modern power systems, this book approaches the issue from the various, current perspectives in the US. These include utilities that are still primarily vertically integrated power providers and systems dominated by independent system operators (ISOs). Outlined here are the basic procedures in a wind valuation study, described with enough detail so that analysts spanning a range of resources and sophistication can reasonably undertake a competent study. Descriptions of studies performed by other utilities are also provided, explaining their specific approaches to the fundamentals. Finally, it includes a short section on power systems that utilize relatively large fractions of wind, and how operating procedures and valuing techniques may need alteration to accommodate them.  • Reviews operating challenges that large amounts of wind power present to power systems operators  • Outlines alternative approaches to quantifying the systems services necessary to accommodate the wind  • Explains how economic analyses of wind generation are competently performed  • Describes how to represent wind generation in computer models commonly used by electric utility planners that may not be specifically designed to incorporate wind generation  • Reviews methods used by some select utility companies around the United States  • Touches on key European issues involving relatively high levels of wind generation  • Written at the level of the utility planner, assuming a basic understanding of economic dispatch of generators and elementary statistics  Key Features   Outlines the role of wind forecasting in wind valuation studies  Evaluates the importance of estimating wind generation to meet peak demand  Researches how the market structure effects the value of wind energy   Discusses power systems that utilize relatively large fractions of wind power  Highlights the operating procedures that can enhance the value of wind generation  Author Information By Ken Dragoon ","PKR 29,423.00","KEN DRAGOON",9780815520474,2010,"ENGINEERING > ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING",1,"Hard Cover",English,229,images/books/9780815520474.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9780815520474&opt=3&sUBcAT=04

Process disturbances and various defect mechanisms contribute to the increasing number of unstable SRAM cells with parametric sensitivity. Growing sizes of SRAM arrays increase the likelihood of cells with marginal stability and pose strict constraints on transistor parameters distributions.  Standard functional tests often fail to detect unstable SRAM cells. Undetected unstable cells deteriorate quality and reliability of the product as such cells may fail to retain the data and cause a system failure. Special design and test measures have to be taken to identify cells with marginal stability. However, it is not sufficient to identify the unstable cells. To ensure reliable system operation, unstable cells have to be repaired.   CMOS SRAM Circuit Design and Parametric Test in Nano-Scaled Technologies covers a broad range of topics related to SRAM design and test. From SRAM operation basics through cell electrical and physical design to process-aware and economical approach to SRAM testing. The emphasis of the book is on challenges and solutions of stability testing as well as on development of understanding of the link between the process technology and SRAM circuit design in modern nano-scaled technologies.

CO-CLUSTEIRNG(pb)2013,"Cluster or co-cluster analyses are important tools in a variety of scientific areas. The introduction of this book presents a state of the art of already well-established, as well as more recent methods of co-clustering. The authors mainly deal with the two-mode partitioning under different approaches, but pay particular attention to a probabilistic approach. Chapter 1 concerns clustering in general and the model-based clustering in particular. The authors briefly review the classical clustering methods and focus on the mixture model. They present and discuss the use of different mixtures adapted to different types of data. The algorithms used are described and related works with different classical methods are presented and commented upon. This chapter is useful in tackling the problem of co-clustering under the mixture approach. Chapter 2 is devoted to the latent block model proposed in the mixture approach context. The authors discuss this model in detail and present its interest regarding co-clustering. Various algorithms are presented in a general context. Chapter 3 focuses on binary and categorical data. It presents, in detail, the appropriated latent block mixture models. Variants of these models and algorithms are presented and illustrated using examples. Chapter 4 focuses on contingency data. Mutual information, phi-squared and model-based co-clustering are studied. Models, algorithms and connections among different approaches are described and illustrated. Chapter 5 presents the case of continuous data. In the same way, the different approaches used in the previous chapters are extended to this situation.

"HANDBOOK OF SMALL MODULAR NUCLEAR REACTORS (hb)2014","Small modular reactors (SMRs) are an advanced, safe type of nuclear reactor technology that are suitable for small and medium sized applications including both power and heat generation. In particular, their use as individual units or in combination to scale-up capacity offer benefits in terms of siting, installation, operation, lifecycle and economics in comparison to the development of larger nuclear plant for centralised electricity power grids. Interest has increased in the research and development of SMRs for both developing countries as well as such additional cogeneration options as industrial/chemical process heat, desalination and district heating, and hydrogen production. This book reviews key issues in their development as well as international R&D in the field. Gives an overview of small modular reactor technologyReviews the design characteristics of integral pressurized water reactors and focuses on reactor core and fuel technologies, key reactor system components, instrumentation and control, human-system interfaces and safetyConsiders the economics, financing, licensing, construction methods and hybrid energy systems of small modular reactorsDescribes SMR development activities worldwide, and concludes with a discussion of how SMR deployment can contribute to the growth of developing countries   Author: Mario D.

"IRRADIATION EMBRITTLEMENT OF REACTOR PRSSURE VESSELS (RPVs) IN NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS(hb)2014","Key Features  •Discusses reactor pressure vessel (RPV) design and the effect irradiation embrittlement can have, the main degradation mechanism affecting RPVs •Examines embrittlement processes in RPVs in different reactor types, as well as techniques for studying RPV embrittlement  Description  Reactor Pressure Vessels (RPVs) contain the fuel and therefore the reaction at the heart of nuclear power plants. They are a life-determining structural component: if they suffer serious damage, the continued operation of the plant is in jeopardy. This book critically reviews irradiation embrittlement, the main degradation mechanism affecting RPV steels, and mitigation routes for managing the RPV lifetime.   Part I reviews RPV design and fabrication in different countries, with an emphasis on the materials required, their important properties, and manufacturing technologies. Part II then considers RVP embrittlement in operational nuclear power plants using different reactors. Chapters are devoted to embrittlement in light-water reactors, including WWER-type reactors and Magnox reactors. Finally, Part III presents techniques for studying embrittlement, including irradiation simulation techniques, microstructural characterisation techniques, and probabilistic fracture mechanics.  Irradiation Embrittlement of Reactor Pressure Vessels (RPVs) in Nuclear Power Plants provides a thorough review of an issue that is central to the safety of nuclear power generation. The book includes contributions from an international team of experts, and will be a useful resource for nuclear plant operators and managers, relevant regulatory and safety bodies, nuclear metallurgists and other academics in this field  Naoki Soneda  Dr Naoki Soneda is an Associate Vice President at the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Japan, and is the author of numerous papers on RVP steels.

"EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY (pb)","Michael Faraday (1791–1867) was the greatest physicist of the nineteenth century, a pioneer in experimentation in the fields of electricity and magnetism. He is best known for his discovery of the principle of electromagnetic induction and the laws of electrolysis. In Experimental Researches in Electricity, first published in three volumes between 1839 and 1855, Faraday discusses the inquiries that led to his development of the first dynamo (the precursor of modern dynamos and generators), and his establishment of the foundations of classical field theory. His descriptions contain scarcely a hint of mathematics, and he relates the progress of his experiments in direct, clear language. Using the primitive tools available to him in his time, in conjunction with his great imaginative gifts, Faraday explains how he arrived at his profound conclusions with stunning simplicity.

Robert Resnick is professor emeritus at Rensselaer and the former Edward P. Hamilton Distinguished Professor of Science Education, 1974-93. Together with his co-author David Halliday, he revolutionized physics education with their now famous textbook on general physics, still one of the most highly regarded texts in the field today.  Jearl Walker, professor of physics at Cleveland State University, received his BS in physics from MIT in 1967 and his PhD in physics from University of Maryland in 1973. His book The Flying Circus of Physics was published 30 years ago, has been translated into at least 10 languages, and is still being sold world wide. For 16 years he toured his Flying Circus talk throughout the U.S. and Canada, introducing such physics stunts as the bed-of-nails demonstration and the walking-on-hot-coals demonstration to countless physics teachers, who then proceeded to hurt themselves when they repeated the stunts in their own classrooms.

Designed for readers with no science background, the book introduces them to the thought processes used by electrical engineers to think quantitatively and then design useful systems. As a result, readers not only learn the facts behind information and transmission, coding and storage, but how these systems came to be developed in response to a shift of information to a digital medium. Unlike traditional science texts that begin with theory and then illustrate that theory with applications, this book starts with practical, real-world systems and then presents the physical theory and mathematical analysis required to understand their operation.

The second section progresses logically into an exploration of the circuitry used to construct electronics systems, including: active filters, oscillators, differential amplifiers, voltage regulators, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog converters, power amplifiers, and phase-control circuits using SCRs and Triacs. Pre-labs at the end of each chapter simulate the hardware lab experiments while requiring use of a calculator and, if possible, verification of results using MultiSIM or other electronic analysis software.

"FIELD AND WAVE ELECTROMAGNETICS 2e(pb)2009","The many books on introductory electromagnetics can be roughly divided into two main groups. The first group takes the traditional development: starting with the experimental laws  generalizing them in steps  and finally synthesizing them in the form of Maxwell s equations. This is an inductive approach. The second group takes the axiomatic development: starting with Maxwell s equations  identifying each with the appropriate experimental law  and specializing the general equations to static and time-varying situations for analysis. This is a deductive approach. A few books begin with a treatment of the special theory of relativity and develop all of electromagnetic theory from Coulomb s law of force; but this approach requires the discussion and understanding of the special theory of relativity first and is perhaps best suited for a course at an advanced level. Proponents of the traditional development argue that it is the way electromagnetic theory was unraveled historically (from special experimental laws to Maxwell s equations)  and that it is easier for the students to follow than the other methods. I feel  however  that the way a body of knowledge was unraveled is not necessarily the best way to teach the subject to students. The topics tend to be fragmented and cannot take full advantage of the conciseness of vector calculus. Students are puzzled at  and often form a mental block to  the subsequent introduction of gradient  divergence  and curl operations. As a process for formulating an electromagnetic model  this approach lacks cohesiveness and elegance. The axiomatic development usually begins with the set of four Maxwell s equations  either in differential or in integral from  as fundamental postulates. These are equations of considerable complexity and are difficult to master. They are likely to cause consternation and resistance in students who are hit with all of them at the beginning of a book. Alert students will wonder about the meaning of the field vectors and about the necessity and sufficiency of these general equations. At the final stage students tend to be confused about the concepts of the electromagnetic model  and they are not yet comfortable with the associated mathematical manipulations. In any case  the general Maxwell s equations are soon simplified to apply to static fields  which allow the consideration of electrostatic fields and magnetostatic fields separately. Why then should the entire set of four Maxwell s equations be introduced at the outset?    Author:  David K. Cheng","PKR 749.00","DAVID K.

"HOLOGRAPHIC INTERFEROMETRY (hb)2012","Transparent in the visible range, phase objects can be studied in the optical range using holographic interferometry. Typically, the holograms are recorded on high-resolving-power holographic photo materials, but a lower spatial resolution is sufficient for successful research in many scientific applications. Holographic Interferometry: A Mach–Zehnder Approach offers practical guidance to research scientists and engineers using Mach–Zehnder holographic interferometry methods to study phase objects in the laboratory. The Mach–Zehnder approach allows the use of standard photographic film and electronic CCD/CMOS sensors with low resolving power, making it a simpler and more affordable option for testing many types of phase objects.  This book demonstrates how to use standard photographic film for the optical recording and reconstruction of Mach–Zehnder holograms. It also illustrates techniques for using CCD/CMOS cameras to digitally record Mach–Zehnder holograms/interferograms of transparent objects. Bringing together original research and information scattered throughout existing literature, this book focuses on the holographic reference beam and shearing interferometry methods. In particular, it looks at how these methods and optical schemes can be directly applied to testing aerodynamic flows, as well as to plasmas, shocks, and waves in noncoherent laser–matter interactions.   Numerous reconstructed and classic interferograms, deflectograms, and Schlierengrams illustrate the material, helping readers develop and design their own optimal optical scheme and choose applicable details to apply the approach.

Several chapters cover graphene, an unzipped form of CNT that is the recently discovered allotrope of carbon that has gained a tremendous amount of scientific and technological interest. The book discusses the development of the graphene nanoribbon field effect transistor (GNRFET) and its use as a possible replacement to overcome the CNT chirality challenge. It also examines silicon nanowire (SiNW) as a new candidate for achieving the downscaling of devices. The text describes the modeling and fabrication of SiNW, including a new top-down fabrication technique. Strained technology, which changes the properties of device materials rather than changing the device geometry, is also discussed.  The book ends with a look at the technical and economic challenges that face the commercialization of nanoelectronics and what universities, industries, and government can do to lower the barriers. A useful resource for professionals, researchers, and scientists, this work brings together state-of-the-art technical and scientific information on important topics in advanced nanoelectronics.

"HOLD PARAMOUNT THE ENGINEER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO SOCIETY 2e(pb)2011","This essential text provides students with practical insight into the engineering code of ethics and how a practicing engineer is obligated to act in a responsible manner. To illustrate the complexities involved with acting in an ethical fashion, the authors have created characters that encounter a number of situations that test the engineering code of ethics. The dialogue between these characters highlights different perspectives of realistic situations that students will face as practicing engineers. As they proceed through the book, students see how the code can help in decision making, as well as the implications of various decisions. The philosophical theory that supports the ethical positions encountered is presented as boxed material following each section.  ","PKR 6,538.00","P.

"TECHNOLOGY & INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS (hb)1997","In Technology and Industrial Progress, Nick von Tunzelmann examines theoretical views on the nature and contribution of technology, and the empirical evidence from the major industrializing countries from the eighteenth Century to the present day. The experiences of countries regarded in their time as the leaders of industrialization – Britain in the eighteenthth century, the United States in the nineteenth century and Japan in the twentieth century – are critically compared by the author. The following chapters study the transfer of each of these patterns of technology and growth to later industrializers, such as continental Europe, the Soviet Union, and today’s newly industrializing countries. Adopting approaches drawn from evolutionary economics, Dr von Tunzelmann links micro-level phenomena relating to individual firms and technologies to macro-level outcomes as reflected in economic growth and development.

"KNITTING TECHNOLOGY A COMPREHENSIVE H/BK AND PRACTICAL GUIDE 3e(hb)2005","The third edition of Knitting Technology, widely recognised as the definitive text on the subject, has been thoroughly revised and updated to include all the latest developments. Beginning with the fundamental principles and moving on to more advanced aspects, it combines in a single comprehensive volume the basics of warp and weft knitting, fabric structures and products, the different types of machines, principles of production and terminology to provide an invaluable reference for textiles students, textile engineers and technicians involved in knitted garment design and manufacture.  Fundamental rules and principles are emphasised throughout. Aspects covered include flat, circular, full fashioned, hosiery, raschel, tricot and crochet production. Development of the various types of knitting machines, their actions and mechanisms as well as the construction, properties and end uses of the products which they manufacture are also included.  The book is indexed and referenced in detail and includes numerous labelled diagrams and photographs. Terminology is defined either according to The Textile Institute's terms and definitions or current usage in the industry and is supplemented where necessary by American or continental terminology. Although SI units and the tex yarn count system are explained and used in the text, other systems have also been employed wherever it has been considered that their usage is still important. A number of worked calculations are included to clarify the examples given.  Knitting technology is the ideal textbook for a range of textile courses from technician to degree level and The Textile Institute's examinations as well as being an essential companion to all those involved in the knitting industry.

"SUSTAINABLE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND WASTE MANAGEMENT: CRADLE-TO-CRADLE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (hb) 2007","Sustainable Industrial Design and Waste Management was inspired by the need to have a text that enveloped awareness and solutions to the ongoing issues and concerns of waste generated from industry. The development of science and technology has increased human capacity to extract resources from nature and it is only recently that industries are being held accountable for the detrimental effects the waste they produce has on the environment. Increased governmental research, regulation and corporate accountability are digging up issues pertaining to pollution control and waste treatment and environmental protection.  The traditional approach for clinical waste, agricultural waste, industrial waste, and municipal waste are depleting our natural resources. The main objective of this book is to conserve the natural resources by approaching 100 % full utilization of all types of wastes by cradle – to - cradle concepts, using Industrial Ecology methodology documented with case studies. Sustainable development and environmental protection cannot be achieved without establishing the concept of industrial ecology. The main tools necessary for establishing Industrial Ecology and sustainable development will be covered in the book. The concept of “industrial ecology” will help the industrial system to be managed and operated more or less like a natural ecosystem hence causing as less damage as possible to the surrounding environment.

"METAHEURISTIC OPTIMIZATION FOR THE DESIGN OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL LAWS (hb)2013","The classic approach in Automatic Control relies on the use of simplified models of the systems and reformulations of the specifications. In this framework, the control law can be computed using deterministic algorithms. However, this approach fails when the system is too complex for its model to be sufficiently simplified, when the designer has many constraints to take into account, or when the goal is not only to design a control but also to optimize it. This book presents a new trend in Automatic Control with the use of metaheuristic algorithms. These kinds of algorithm can optimize any criterion and constraint, and therefore do not need such simplifications and reformulations. The first chapter outlines the author’s main motivations for the approach which he proposes, and presents the advantages which it offers. In Chapter 2, he deals with the problem of system identification. The third and fourth chapters are the core of the book where the design and optimization of control law, using the metaheuristic method (particle swarm optimization), is given. The proposed approach is presented along with real-life experiments, proving the efficiency of the methodology. Finally, in Chapter 5, the author proposes solving the problem of predictive control of hybrid systems.  Author: Guillaume Sandou is Professor in the Automatic Department of Supélec, in Gif Sur Yvette, France.

"INTRODUCTION TO CONTINUUM MECHANICS (pb) 2005","This book presents an introduction to the classical theories of continuum mechanics; in particular, to the theories of ideal, compressible, and viscous fluids, and to the linear and nonlinear theories of elasticity. These theories are important, not only because they are applicable to a majority of the problems in continuum mechanics arising in practice, but because they form a solid base upon which one can readily construct more complex theories of material behavior. Further, although attention is limited to the classical theories, the treatment is modern with a major emphasis on foundations and structure.

"FOUNDATIONS OF PROBABILITY (pb)","Taking an innovative approach to both content and methods, this book explores the foundations, basic concepts, and fundamental results of probability theory. Geared toward those unfamiliar with probability theory, it offers a firm basis for the study of topics related to the probability of mathematical statistics and to information theory.The effective construction of probability spaces receives particular attention. Author Alfred Rényi—former Director of the Mathematical Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and an expert in the fields of probability theory, mathematical statistics, and number theory—considered effective construction of probability spaces particularly important to applying methods and results of probability theory to other branches of mathematics. Professor Rényi discusses basic theorems of probability theory in terms specific to the theorem in question, rather than in the most general form. His rigorous treatment also covers the mathematical notions of experiments and independence, the laws of chance for independent random variables, and the effects of dependence. Two brief appendixes offer helpful background in measure theory and functional analysis.

More importantly, the entire text has been revised and contains more detailed explanations of the presented material. In doing so, the book explores a number of important examples and constructions of pathological functions.   After introducing basic concepts, the author begins with Cantor and Peano-type functions, then moves effortlessly to functions whose constructions require what is essentially non-effective methods. These include functions without the Baire property, functions associated with a Hamel basis of the real line and Sierpinski-Zygmund functions that are discontinuous on each subset of the real line having the cardinality continuum.  Finally, the author considers examples of functions whose existence cannot be established without the help of additional set-theoretical axioms.

"DESIGN OF FLUID THERMAL SYSTEMS, 2e (pb) 1998","This book is designed to serve senior-level engineering students taking a capstone design course in fluid and thermal systems design. It is built from the ground up with the needs and interests of practicing engineers in mind; the emphasis is on practical applications. The book begins with a discussion of design methodology, including the process of bidding to obtain a project, and project management techniques. The text continues with an introductory overview of fluid thermal systems (a pump and pumping system, a household air conditioner, a baseboard heater, a water slide, and a vacuum cleaner are among the examples given), and a review of the properties of fluids and the equations of fluid mechanics. The text then offers an in-depth discussion of piping systems, including the economics of pipe size selection. Janna examines pumps (including net positive suction head considerations) and piping systems. He provides the reader with the ability to design an entire system for moving fluids that is efficient and cost-effective. Next, the book provides a review of basic heat transfer principles, and the analysis of heat exchangers, including double pipe, shell and tube, plate and frame cross flow heat exchangers. Design considerations for these exchangers are also discussed. The text concludes with a chapter (10) of term projects that may be undertaken by teams of students.  Author: William S.

"ENGINEERING HANDBOOK (IN TWO PARTS), THE (2 VOL) (hb)98","The term Electronics is used in the field of electrical Engineering to distinguish devices and phenomena that depend on the motion of charge carriers in a semiconductor, vacuum or gas, from those that depend on the motion of charge carriers in a metal. Electrical engineering began with motors, generators, light bulbs, telegraphy and so on, but today electronics is by far the dominant area of interest and activity. Perhaps more than any one of technology, it is advances in electronics that have provided the foundation on which our modern world is built. The purpose of The Engineering Handbook is to provide in a single volume a ready, reference for the practising engineer in industry, government and academia. This Book in its comprehensive format is divided into 30 sections which encompass the field of engineering. The goal is to provide the most up-to-date information in the classical fields that comprise mechanical, electrical, civil, chemical, industrial and aerospace engineering as well as the underlying fields of Mathematics and materials. This book should serve the information needs of all professional engineers engaged in the practice of the profession whether in industry, education or government. The goal of this comprehensive handbook is to replace a myriad of books with one highly informative, well organised, definitive, source of fundamental knowledge. The fundamentals of engineering have evolved to include a wide range of knowledge, substantial empirical data, and a broad range of practice. The focus of the handbook is on the key concepts, models, and equations that enable the engineer to analyze, design and predict the behaviour of complex devices, circuits, instruments, systems, structures, plants, computers, fuels and the environment. While data and formulae are summarized, the main focus is the provision of the underlying theories and concepts and the appropriate application of these theories to the field of engineering. Thus, the reader will find the key concepts defined, described, and illustrated in order to serve the needs of the engineer over many years. With equal emphasis placed on materials, structures, mechanics, dynamics, fluids, thermodynamics, fuels and energy, transportation, environmental systems, circuits and system, computers and instruments, manufacturing, aeronautical and aerospace, and Economics and Management as well as mathematics, the engineer should encounter a wide range of concepts and considerable depth of exploration of these concepts as they lead to application and design.

"MECHANICS AND MATERIALS (W/CD) (pb)2003","Mechanics of Materials covers all the material found in other Mechanics of Materials texts. What's unique is that Pytel and Kiusalaas separate coverage of basic principles from that of special topics. The authors also apply their time-tested problem solving methodology, which incorporates outlines of procedures and numerous sample problems to help ease students' transition from theory to problem analysis. The result? Your students get the broad introduction to the field that they need along with the problem-solving skills and understanding that will help them in their subsequent studies.To demonstrate, the authors introduce the topic of beams using ideal model as being perfectly elastic, straight bar with a symmetric cross section in ch. 4. They also defer the general transformation equations for stress and strain (including Mohr's Circle) until the students have gained experience with the basics of simple stress and strain. Later, more complicated applications of the principles such as energy methods, inelastic behavior, stress concentrations, and unsymmetrical bending are discussed in ch. 11 - 13 eliminating the need to skip over material when teaching the basics  * The book is concise, but covers all the material found in other introductory Mechanics of Materials texts. The first eight chapters cover fundamental concepts - clearly and simply - without clouding students' understanding with details about special cases and advanced topics. These chapters place an exclusive emphasis on elastic analysis through the presentation of stress, strain, torsion, bending, and combined loading  * Unlike many texts, coverage of advanced topics (e.g., inelastic behavior, stress, concentrations, unsymmetrical bending, theories of failure, and energy methods) is confined to the last five chapters. This makes it easy to omit or include these topics as you wish, and eliminates the need to skip over material when teaching the fundamentals  * In the derivation of formulas, the authors emphasize the physical situation before implementing mathematics to model the problem. * Virtually, every article is immediately illustrated by sample problems and homework problems that illustrate the principles and the problem-solving procedure introduced in the article  * End-of-chapter homework exercises serve as a review of the material covered in the chapter.

"ENGG.OPTIMIZATION METHODS AND APPLICATION 2e(pb)2003","In the most general terms, optimization theory is a body of mathematical results and numerical methods for finding and identifying the best candidate from a collection of alternatives without having to explicitly enumerate and evaluate all possible alternatives. The process of optimization lies at the root of engineering, since the classical function of the engineer is to design new, better, more efficient and less expensive systems as well as to devise plans and procedures for the improved operation of existing systems. Most optimization routines are lengthy and therefore are efficiently applied through the use of the computer, but an understanding of the processes is needed to identify needs and interpret results. This book supplies the student and practicing engineer with the tools to understand and use optimization theory. · introduction to optimization · functions of a single variable · functions of several variables · linear programming · constrained optimality criteria · transformation methods · constrained direct search · linearization methods for constrained problems · direction generation methods based on linearization · quadratic approximation methods for constrained problems · structured problems and algorithms · comparison of constrained optimization methods · strategies for optimization studies · engineering case studies  Author: G.

"MODERN DIESEL TECHNOLOGY: HEAVY EQUIPMENT SYSTEMS (pb) 2008","Modern Diesel Technology: Heavy Equipment Systems is the only textbook on the market that deals exclusively with off-highway mobile equipment systems. Designed to meet the specific needs of technicians in the specialty areas of heavy equipment, agricultural equipment, and powered lift truck technology, this book marks a valuable departure from the books aimed at truck technicians and the manufacturer-produced literature that specialty technicians have had to rely on for so long. The book begins with a chapter on basic safety, and is then broken down into four sections to address the four key elements of heavy equipment systems: hydraulics, heavy duty brake systems, drive train systems, and steering, suspension, and track systems. Written by an author team with extensive experience, both as professionals in the industry and as teachers of specialty technician programs, this book will provide readers with an in-depth understanding of the skills and concepts needed to be an effective technician in this specialty field.

"SI-SYSTEM DYNAMICS AND RESPONSE VERSION (pb) 2008","As engineering systems become more increasingly interdisciplinary, knowledge of both mechanical and electrical systems has become an asset within the field of engineering. All engineers should have general facility with modeling of dynamic systems and determining their response and it is the objective of this book to provide a framework for that understanding. The study material is presented in four distinct parts; the mathematical modeling of dynamic systems, the mathematical solution of the differential equations and integro differential equations obtained during the modeling process, the response of dynamic systems, and an introduction to feedback control systems and their analysis. An Appendix is provided with a short introduction to MATLAB as it is frequently used within the text as a computational tool, a programming tool, and a graphical tool. SIMULINK, a MATLAB based simulation and modeling tool, is discussed in chapters where the development of models use either the transfer function approach or the state-space method.  About the Author Dr. S. Graham Kelly has been a faculty member and administrator at The University of Akron since 1982. He is the author of one textbook in Vibrations, now in its second edition, another text on System Dynamics and Response, and the author of the Schaum's Outline in Mechanical Vibrations.

"RAPID LOAD TESTING ON PILES (hb)2011","A Rapid Load Test (RLT), developed to determine the initial stiffness and bearing capacity, is an economical and practical alternative to a Static Load Test (SLT). The broad application of RLT, however, was hampered by uncertainty about the interpretation of the test results. This book offers clear guidance on the available analysis techniques and their reliability.  The guidelines were related to an international standard that is drawn up by CEN and can be used in two ways:  •Straightforward interpretation of test results, chapters 1-3 •Interpretation with additional background information about the possibilities and limitations, chapters 4-8 The guidelines were drawn up by the Dutch CUR-committee on rapid load testing on piles.  Chapters 1 and 2 deal with the practical execution of the test and the presentation of the results. Chapter 3 gives a general overview of existing interpretation methods and refers to step-by-step descriptions of the two advised interpretation methods.  The aspects that are important for the interpretation are discussed in chapter 4, also showing that the inertia of the pile should be taken into account. In clay soil the rate effect (the dependency of strength and stiffness on loading rate) is also of importance, whereas in sand and silt the generation of pore water pressures during an RLT plays a role. The velocity of the RLT is such that the reaction of sand and silt might be considered as partially drained. These guidelines indicate how these effects can be compensated to obtain the static resistance in the final results.   Chapter 5 presents two interpretation methods (a method for piles in sand, gravel, silt and piles on rock and a method for piles in clay). For practical use, the methods are described in a step-by-step scheme in an appendix.

"APPLIED MECHANICS OF SOLIDS (INDIAN REPRINT 2012) (hb)2012","Modern computer simulations make stress analysis easy. As they continue to replace classical mathematical methods of analysis, these software programs require users to have a solid understanding of the fundamental principles on which they are based.  Applied Mechanics of Solids is a powerful tool for understanding how to take advantage of these revolutionary computer advances in the field of solid mechanics. Beginning with a description of the physical and mathematical laws that govern deformation in solids, the text presents modern constitutive equations, as well as analytical and computational methods of stress analysis and fracture mechanics. It also addresses the nonlinear theory of deformable rods, membranes, plates, and shells, and solutions to important boundary and initial value problems in solid mechanics.  The author uses the step-by-step manner of a blackboard lecture to explain problem solving methods, often providing the solution to a problem before its derivation is presented. Borrowing from the classical literature on linear elasticity, plasticity, and structural mechanics, this book:  Introduces concepts, analytical techniques, and numerical methods used to analyze deformation, stress, and failure in materials or components Discusses the use of finite element software for stress analysis Uses simple analytical solutions to explain how to set up properly posed boundary and initial-value problems  Provides an understanding of algorithms implemented in software code  Complemented by the author’s website, which features problem sets and sample code for self study, this book offers a crucial overview of problem solving for solid mechanics.

"SIMILARITY AND MODELING IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (hb)2013","The present text sets itself in relief to other titles on the subject in that it addresses the means and methodologies versus a narrow specific-task oriented approach. Concepts and their developments which evolved to meet the changing needs of applications are addressed. This approach provides the reader with a general tool-box to apply to their specific needs. Two important tools are presented: dimensional analysis and the similarity analysis methods. The fundamental point of view, enabling one to sort all models, is that of information flux between a model and an original expressed by the similarity and abstraction Each chapter includes original examples and applications. In this respect, the models can be divided into several groups. The following models are dealt with separately by chapter; mathematical and physical models, physical analogues, deterministic, stochastic, and cybernetic computer models. The mathematical models are divided into asymptotic and phenomenological models. The phenomenological models, which can also be called experimental, are usually the result of an experiment on an complex object or process. The variable dimensionless quantities contain information about the real state of boundary conditions, parameter (non-linearity) changes, and other factors. With satisfactory measurement accuracy and experimental strategy, such models are highly credible and can be used, for example in control systems.

"SPIKE TIMING: MECHANISMS AND FUNCTION (hb)2013","Neuronal communication forms the basis for all behavior, from the smallest movement to our grandest thought processes. Among the many mechanisms that support these functions, spike timing is among the most powerful and—until recently—perhaps the least studied. In the last two decades, however, the study of spike timing has exploded. The heightened interest is due to several factors. These include the development of physiological tools for measuring the activity of neural ensembles and analytical tools for assessing and characterizing spike timing. These advances are coupled with a growing appreciation of spike timing’s theoretical importance for the design principles of the brain.  Spike Timing: Mechanisms and Function examines the function of spike timing in sensory, motor, and integrative processes, providing readers with a broad perspective on how spike timing is produced and used by the nervous system. It brings together the work and ideas of leaders in the field to address current thinking as well as future possibilities.   The first section of the book describes the foundation for quantitative analysis and theory. It examines the information contained in spike timing, how it can be quantified, and how neural systems can extract it. The second section explores how input-output relationships are reflected in spike timing across a range of sensory systems.  Drawing together multiple perspectives, including theoretical and computational studies as well as experimental studies in a range of model systems, the book provides a firm background for investigators to consider spike timing as it applies to their own work. It also offers a glimpse of future advances related to mechanisms of spike timing and its role in neural function, such as the development of novel computational technologies  AUTHOUR Patricia M.

"DESIGN DATA HANDBOOK FOR MECHANICAL ENGINEERS IN SI AND METRIC UNITS 4e (pb) 2013","Machine design is one of the important subjects in mechanical engineering and a thorough knowledge of the design aspects of machine elements is essential for all design engineers. Working out the design of a machine as a whole, or its components, usually involves use ofseveral formulae, graphs, standard tables and other relevant data. Availability of all such information in one handbook not only eliminates the unnecessary task ot remembering the required formulae and equations, but also helps the design engineers to solve the problems in machine design quickly. Design Data Handbook has been prepared keeping these basics in mind. References have been made to several standard textbooks on machine design while compiling the data of this book. In the preparation of the fourth edition, most of the chapters and topics have been upgraded and improved by adding additional information on current design.

"MANGANESE IN POWDER METALLURGY STEELS (hb)2013","The monograph introduces the data about the mechanical properties of sintered manganese steels published since 1948 up to the present time. The effect of all possible material, alloying and sintering factors on the properties of manganese steels which are in most cases on the level of those alloyed with nickel is discussed. The sintering of the steels was successfully carried out under laboratory and industrial conditions not fulfilling the thermodynamic requirements for the Mn–O system. The reduction – (self cleaning) effect of manganese vapour for the sintering atmosphere formed by sublimation due to manganese high vapour pressure is presented as the only possible mechanisms under which the sintering of manganese-containing steels takes place. It is stated conclusively that sintering under this mechanisms occurs without demanganization and decarburization of the compacts in the atmosphere with the low dew point contrary to that with a high dew point adversely affecting the sintering and alloying process.  In this book:  • Thermodynamic conditions for the Mn–O system in sintering of manganese steels • Alloying and sintering of manganese steels in terms of high manganese vapour pressure • Alloying and sintering of manganese steels by manganese vapour  • Effect of base materials and of various processing methods on mechanical and some special properties of manganese steels  • Effect of additional elements on the properties of manganese steels • Properties of sintered and powder forged steels based on prealloyed powders  • Processing and properties of hybrid Fe–(Cr)–xMn–(Mo)–(V) steels • Basic characteristics of manganese steels from the year 1948 • Effect of variable processing conditions and materials on properties of sintered Mn–C steels • Effect of processing conditions and materials on properties of sintered Fe, Cr, Mo, C steels containing manganese • Sintering of manganese steels in low- and high-purity atmospheres: Results and evaluation  ","PKR 4,373.00","MARCELA SELECKA",9788130922973,2013,"ENGINEERING > MECHANICAL ENGINEERING",1,"Hard Cover",English,474,images/books/9788130922973.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9788130922973&opt=3&sUBcAT=04

"FLOW-INDUCED VIBRATIONS: AN ENGINEERING GUIDE (pb)","Despite their variety, the vibration phenomena from many different engineering fields can be classified into a relatively few basic excitation mechanisms. The classification enables engineers to identify all possible sources of excitation in a given system and to assess potential dangers. This graduate-level text presents a synthesis of research results and practical experience from disparate fields in the form of engineering guidelines. It is particularly geared toward assessing the possible sources of excitation in a flow system, in identifying the actual danger spots, and in finding appropriate remedial measures or cures.Flow-induced vibrations are presented in terms of their basic elements: body oscillators, fluid oscillators, and sources of excitation. By stressing these basic elements, the authors provide a basis for the transfer of knowledge from one system to another, as well as from one engineering field to another. In this manner, well-known theories on cylinders in cross-flow or well-executed solutions from the field of wind engineering--to name just two examples--may be useful in other systems or fields on which information is scarce. The unified approach is broad enough to permit treatment of the major excitation mechanism, yet simple enough to be of practical use.

"FINITE ELEMENTS OF NONLINEAR CONTINUA (pb)","Geared toward undergraduate and graduate students, this text extends applications of the finite element method from linear problems in elastic structures to a broad class of practical, nonlinear problems in continuum mechanics. It treats both theory and applications from a general and unifying point of view.The text reviews the thermomechanical principles of continuous media and the properties of the finite element method, and then brings them together to produce discrete physical models of nonlinear continua. The mathematical properties of these models are analyzed, along with the numerical solution of the equations governing the discrete model. Though the theory and methods are sufficiently general to be applied to any nonlinear problem, emphasis has been placed on problems in finite elasticity, viscoelasticity, heat conduction, and thermoviscoelasticity. Problems in rarefied gas dynamics and nonlinear partial differential equations are also examined.Other topics include topological properties of finite element models, applications to linear and nonlinear boundary value problems, and discrete models of nonlinear thermomechanical behavior of dissipative media. This comprehensive text is valuable not only to students of structural analysis and continuum mechanics but also to professionals researching the numerical analysis of continua.  Author: J. T.

"ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY: RESONANCE MACROAND MICRO-MECHANICS OF PETROLEUM RESERVOIRS (hb) 2017","Fossil fuels, especially petroleum, are still the primary energy source all over the world.  With the advent of hydraulic fracturing (i.e. “fracking”), directional drilling, and other technological advances, petroleum and reservoir engineers all over the world have been able to produce much greater results, in much more difficult areas, than ever before, to meet higher global demand.  “Enhanced oil recovery (EOR)” is one of the hottest and most important topics in this industry.  New technologies and processes must be continually discovered and developed, even as renewable energy begins to grow and become more fruitful, as the demand for more and more energy continues to grow worldwide.  This groundbreaking and highly anticipated study discusses the scientific fundamentals of resonance macro- and micro-mechanics of petroleum reservoirs and its petroleum industry applications. It contains an overview of the research and engineering results of resonance macro- and micro-mechanics of petroleum reservoirs, which provide the scientific and applied foundations for the creation of groundbreaking wave technologies for production stimulation and enhanced oil recovery. A valuable tool for the petroleum or reservoir engineer in the field, this volume is also intended for students, teachers, scientists and practitioners who are interested in the fundamentals, development, and application of leading-edge technologies in the petroleum industry and other industrial sectors.

"COOPERATIVE CONTROL OF MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS THEORY AND APPLICATIONS (hb) 2017","A comprehensive review of the state of the art in the control of multi-agent systems theory and applications  The superiority of multi-agent systems over single agents for the control of unmanned air, water and ground vehicles has been clearly demonstrated in a wide range of application areas. Their large-scale spatial distribution, robustness, high scalability and low cost enable multi-agent systems to achieve tasks that could not successfully be performed by even the most sophisticated single-agent systems.  Cooperative Control of Multi-Agent Systems: Theory and Applications provides a wide-ranging review of the latest developments in the cooperative control of multi-agent systems theory and applications. The applications described are mainly in the areas of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Throughout, the authors link basic theory to multi-agent cooperative control practice — illustrated within the context of highly-realistic scenarios of high-level missions — without losing site of the mathematical background needed to provide performance guarantees under general working conditions. Many of the problems and solutions considered involve combinations of both types of vehicles. Topics explored include target assignment, target tracking, consensus, stochastic game theory-based framework, event-triggered control, topology design and identification, coordination under uncertainty and coverage control.  Establishes a bridge between fundamental cooperative control theory and specific problems of interest in a wide range of applications areas Includes example applications from the fields of space exploration, radiation shielding, site clearance, tracking/classification, surveillance, search-and-rescue and more Features detailed presentations of specific algorithms and application frameworks with relevant commercial and military applications Provides a comprehensive look at the latest developments in this rapidly evolving field, while offering informed speculation on future directions for collective control systems  The use of multi-agent system technologies in both everyday commercial use and national defense is certain to increase tremendously in the years ahead, making this book a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and applied mathematicians working in systems and controls, as well as advanced undergraduates and graduate students interested in those areas.

"SOLIDIFICATION: ENGINEERING SCIENCES MATERIALS, 2e (hb) 2016","Solidification is one of the oldest processes for producing complex shapes for applications ranging from art to industry, and remains as one of the most important commercial processes for many materials. Since the 1980s, numerous fundamental developments in the understanding of solidification processes and microstructure formation have come from both analytical theories and the application of computational techniques using commonly available powerful computers. This book integrates these developments in a comprehensive volume that also presents and places them in the context of more classical theories. This second edition highlights the key concepts within each chapter to help guide the reader through the most important aspects of the topics. The figures are now in color, in order to improve the visualization of phenomena and concepts. Recent important developments in the field since the first edition was published have also been added.  The three-part text is aimed at graduate and professional engineers. The first part, Fundamentals and Macroscale Phenomena, presents the thermodynamics of solutions and then builds on that subject to motivate and describe equilibrium phase diagrams. Transport phenomena are discussed next, focusing on the issues of most importance to liquid-solid phase transformations, then moving on to describing in detail both analytical and numerical approaches to solving such problems. The second part, Microstructure, employs these fundamental concepts for the treatment of nucleation, dendritic growth, microsegregation, eutectic and peritectic solidification, and microstructure competition. This part concludes with a chapter describing the coupling of macro- and microscopic phenomena in microstructure development. The third and final part describes various types of Defects that may occur, with emphasis on porosity, hot tearing and macrosegregation, presented using the modeling tools and microstructure descriptions developed earlier.

"INTO THE COOL: ENERGY FLOW THERMODYNAMICS AND LIFE (pb)2005","The what, why and how of life always intrigued human race. Scientists, philosophers and theologians all have tried to answer these questions in their own way. In this interesting book, Eric Schneider and Dorion Sagan explain the basis of life by drawing a parallel between Life and the second law of thermodynamics. This second law refers to energys inevitable tendency to change from being concentrated in one place to becoming spread out over time. In this scientific tour de force, the authors show how the second law is behind evolution, ecology, economics and even lifes origin.

"HANDBOOK OF NANOTECHNOLOGY (hb)2009","One of the biggest scientific trends of the 21st century has been focused on something incredibly small: i.e. of the order of 10 metre. The word nanotechnology means-different things to different people. For some  it conjures up images of fabulous new materials  lighter and stronger than steel. Others envision microscopic robots that clean plaque from our arteries and tartar from our teeth. In the purest sense  nanotechnology is the science on small-very small things measured in units called nanometers  which are one-billionth of a meter. In other words  a nanometer is so small that if one meter were stretched from Kashmir to Kanyakumari  each nanometer would still be the size of an aspirin. The foundations of nanotechnology have emerged over many decades of research in many different fields.  Dr. Parag Diwan is a high technology buff, having worked with organizations like NASA and Semiconductors Complex Ltd. Different facets of high technology from rocket science to microcircuits fascinate him. Currently, apart from his other multifarious interests and responsibilities, he is deeply interested in harnessing the power of ten raised to minus nine(10-9 ), i.e.the nano-world.  He the currently Vice-Chancellor of the University of Petroleum & Energy Studies. Prior to this he was the Dean and Director of the All India Management Association ( AIMA).

"PATTERN FORMATION AND DYNAMICS IN NONEQUILIBRIUM SYSTEMS (hb)2009","Many exciting frontiers of science and engineering require understanding the spatiotemporal properties of sustained nonequilibrium systems such as fluids, plasmas, reacting and diffusing chemicals, crystals solidifying from a melt, heart muscle, and networks of excitable neurons in brains. This introductory textbook for graduate students in biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and physics provides a systematic account of the basic science common to these diverse areas. This book provides a careful pedagogical motivation of key concepts, discusses why diverse nonequilibrium systems often show similar patterns and dynamics, and gives a balanced discussion of the role of experiments, simulation, and analytics. It contains numerous worked examples and over 150 exercises. This book will also interest scientists who want to learn about the experiments, simulations, and theory that explain how complex patterns form in sustained nonequilibrium systems.

"DYNAMICS OF SELF-ORGANIZED AND SELF-ASSEMBLED STRUCTURES (hb)2009","Physical and biological systems driven out of equilibrium may spontaneously evolve to form spatial structures. In some systems molecular constituents may self-assemble to produce complex ordered structures. This book describes how such pattern formation processes occur and how they can be modeled. Experimental observations are used to introduce the diverse systems and phenomena leading to pattern formation. The physical origins of various spatial structures are discussed, and models for their formation are constructed. In contrast to many treatments, pattern-forming processes in nonequilibrium systems are treated in a coherent fashion. The book shows how near-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium modeling concepts are often combined to describe physical systems. This inter-disciplinary book can form the basis of graduate courses in pattern formation and self-assembly. It is a useful reference for graduate students and researchers in a number of disciplines, including condensed matter science, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, chemical biophysics, materials science, and engineering.

"NUCLEAR REACTIONS FOR ASTROPHYSICS (hb)2009","Describing the processes in stars which produce the chemical elements for planets and life, this book shows how similar processes may be reproduced in laboratories using exotic beams, and how these results can be analyzed. Beginning with one-channel scattering theory, the book builds up to multi-channel reactions. Emphasis is placed on using transfer and breakup reactions to probe structure and predict capture processes, as well as R-matrix methods for modeling compound nucleus dynamics described by Hauser-Feshbach methods. Practical applications are prominent in this book, confronting theory predictions with data throughout. The associated reaction program Fresco is described, allowing readers to apply the methods to practical cases.

The first is to introduce the concept of orthogonal sets of functions and representations of arbitrary functions in series of functions from such sets. The second is a clear presentation of the classical method of separation of variables used in solving boundary value problems with the aid of those representations.   Key Features:  • NEW! Reorganization of Topics: Topics in the text have been realigned to allow for more focus on each section and to allow for more examples. The chapter on The Fourier Method has been moved earlier in the book (now Chapter 2). The former Fourier Series chapter has been split into two chapters (Chapter 3: Orthonormal Sets and Fourier Series and Chapter 4: Convergence of Fourier Series).  • NEW! Problem Sets Revised: Problem sets have been broken up into more manageable segments to allow for each problem set to be very focused.  • NEW! Examples Added: Additional examples have been added in each chapter to help illustrate important topics.  • Primary Focus: The text's primary focus is to find solutions to specific problems, rather than developing general theories.

"VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLES IN DYNAMICS AND QUANTUM THEORY (pb)","Focusing on applications most relevant to modern physics, this text surveys variational principles and examines their relationship to dynamics and quantum theory. It stresses the history and theory of these mathematical concepts rather than their mechanics, providing many insights into the development of quantum mechanics in a remarkably lucid, compact form. Professional physicists and mathematicians, as well as advanced students with a strong mathematical background, will find it highly stimulating.After summarizing the historical background from Pythagoras to Francis Bacon, the text covers Fermat's principle of least time, the principle of least action of Maupertuis, the development of this principle by Euler and Lagrange, and the equations of Lagrange and Hamilton. After this general treatment of variational principles, the authors proceed to derive Hamilton's principle, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and Hamilton's canonical equations.An investigation of electrodynamics in Hamiltonian form follows, along with an overview of variational principles in classical dynamics. The text then analyzes its most significant topics: the relation between variational principles and wave mechanics, and the principles of Feynman and Schwinger in quantum mechanics. Two concluding chapters extend the discussion to hydrodynamics and natural philosophy.

"NEW APPROACHES TO QUANTUM PHYSICS (hb) 2015","The old paradigm of linear quantum mechanics is worn out. It is therefore urgent to replace it with a new approach, one which accepts a reality independent from the observer and which solves the paradoxes and enigmas that popular theories continue to stimulate.  This book, in a language accessible not only to scholars but to everyone, exposes the insufficiencies of the orthodox and dominant linear quantum physics, and also demonstrates that time has come to bet on a new quantum physics, a causal and nonlinear physics, which for the time being is heterodox.  We are invited here to view the most outstanding events in the history of astronomy and physics; we are also confronted with the epistemological debates that prove decisive to the future course of this area of knowledge; moreover, we are led to re-evaluate many conceptions which are, after all, fallacious, and supposedly integrate “true science”; and finally we are led, in rigor and clarity, through the meanders of an innovative interpretation of quantum physics, based upon the complexity and nonlinearity, which will be the foundation to the most promising research programmes.  In this book:  • A Sort of Introduction  • History and Epistemology  • The Enigmas and Paradoxes of Quantum Physics  • Nonlinear Quantum Physics  About the Authors:  J R Croca, PhD in Theoretical Physics, professor and researcher at the University of Lisbon, he focuses his activity on the Fundamentals of Quantum Physics. He is the author of numerous works on the modern causal and nonlinear quantum physics, most of which have been published in international reviews in this field. By invitation from the editor, he recently authored the book Towards a Nonlinear Quantum Physics (World Scientific Publishing).  R N Moreira, graduated in Mechanical Engineering, Applied Thermodynamics branch. He did the training and registered in the Order of Engineers. However, he sought to know the fundamentals of engineering in greater detail, having thus decided to attend the physics course at the Faculty of Science of the Lisbon University.

"COMPACT PLASMA AND FOCUSED ION BEAMS (pb) 2017","Recent research has brought the application of microwaves from the classical fields of heating, communication, and generation of plasma discharges into the generation of compact plasmas that can be used for applications such as FIB and small plasma thrusters. However, these new applications bring with them a new set of challenges. With coverage ranging from the basics to new and emerging applications, Compact Plasma and Focused Ion Beams discusses how compact high-density microwave plasmas with dimensions smaller than the geometrical cutoff dimension can be generated and utilized for providing focused ion beams of various elements.  Starting with the fundamentals of the cutoff problem for wave propagation in waveguides and plasma diagnostics, the author goes on to explain in detail the plasma production by microwaves in a compact geometry and narrow tubes. He then thoroughly discusses wave interaction with bounded plasmas and provides a deeper understanding of the physics. The book concludes with an up-to-date account of recent research on pulsed microwaves and the application of compact microwave plasmas for multi-element FIB.  It provides a consolidated and unified description of the emerging areas in plasma science and technology utilizing wave-based plasma sources based on the author’s own work and experience. The book will be useful not only to established researchers in this area but will also serve as an excellent introduction to those interested in applying these ideas to various current and new applications.
