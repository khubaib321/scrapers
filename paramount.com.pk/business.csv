"ESSENTIALS OF ECONOMICS 8e (pb) 2019","Why study economics?  Economic decisions are central to societies, firms, governments and individuals    Our lives are dominated by our economic situation. Some people are rich; others are poor. Some people have good jobs; others just get paid minimum wages; others are unemployed. Some people spend their money wisely; others waste money.    We are also affected by government economic policy. Governments choose how much to tax us and in what way; they choose how much to spend and on what. They try to manage the economy to achieve economic growth, falling unemployment and a stable financial system; but political parties often disagree on the best way to do this.  Economists advise governments, firms, charities and other interest groups on how best to achieve their objectives. Their advice is crucial to good decision making: to making the best choices between alternatives.  But to give good advice requires understanding issues and assessing evidence. Studying economics helps you to do this – to become a better problem solver.  Being good at analysing and solving problems makes economists employable. In fact, graduates who have studied economics are highly sought after by employers and can command high salaries.  This book looks at the key economic issues of today; from economic growth to recessions and unemployment; from trade to Brexit; from wages and employment to inequality and poverty; from producing more to caring for the environment; from competition to the domination of markets by powerful firms; from government spending more on what we need to tackling budget deficits.  The book is full of case studies and examples and opportunities for you to reflect on your learning. It helps you to develop the skills and knowledge to make you a more effective employee and a more informed member of society.  Economics is exciting and relevant to us all – as you’ll discover in the pages of this book.

"SOFT SKILLS PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT FOR LIFE SUCCESS (pb) 2018","This Book is a comprehensive guide to Leadership, Teamwork, Business Communication, Creativity, Interpersonal Skills, Emotional Intelligence, Body Language, First Impression, Time Management, Etiquette, Public Speaking, Group Discussion, Job Interviews, Negotiation Skills and Professionalism. This book comes with a CD that contains Coaching for Life Success, Career Advancement & Goal Setting. * This Book Comes with CD Contains Training for Life Success, Career Advancement & Goal Setting.  This high-impact book has been written by an experienced industry professional with a corporate perspective. The author is a Master Trainer who approaches the soft skills training from the point of view of a corporate soft skills training. Written in a business storytelling format, the training in the book is imparted by a skillful industry leader. This has not been written as the theoretical exercise. No boring theory, no wasted time! Rather, each chapter has been approached as a working session: Imparting soft skills by solving real problems and discussing workable solutions which the reader can apply immediately and keep for life. The structure of the book is in the form of a Personal Development Compass developed by the author. Just as a compass guides travelers through their journey and helps them to reach their destination, in the same way, the Personal Development Compass too guides the reader to navigate their way through the maze of the different soft skills and help them to polish their personalities. The methodology applied is `Learning-By Doing': This approach can be summed up as follows: `Educate Briefly-Then Train at Length'- On other words, less focus on theory, more real-world action, and solutions. The training imparted in the book starts with the Personality Development objective in mind and then facilitates and demonstrates methods to achieve those objectives.  The book has been designed to take the reader through three main VERTICALS   VERTICAL 1:   Theme: CONFIDENCE  Headings: RELATIONSHIPS & WELL-BEING  This vertical helps the reader in gaining the mental strength, motivation & confidence to approach their lives with a Positive Mental Attitude. The ability to be optimistic even in dire situations enables them to develop Emotional Intelligence and have meaningful relationships with their peers and colleagues, paving the way for the next level of Competence.  VERTICAL 2:   Theme: COMPETENCE  Headings: COMMUNICATION & CAREER  Good Communication is a huge demand from recruiters and employers today. In fact, it is a pre-requisite for success. Effective Communication helps the reader to get a head start in their careers. They are able to think fast and creatively, impress and convince others of their point of view, they develop good listening skills thereby gaining an edge over others. They become the candidates of choice for promotion and progress.  VERTICAL 3:   Theme: COURTESY  Headings: ETIQUETTE & HABITS  There is a popular saying: The First Impression is the last Impression. A good first impression is created through effective habits and an ability to say the right thing at the right time to the right person. To develop these skills, the reader learns to exhibit appropriate behavior in all situations: personal and professional. Sustained behavior becomes a habit. This then becomes part of the reader’s basic nature.   A Good professional need to have strong Language skills. Recognizing this need, the book has a section in every chapter that highlights important words and Business phrases used in the corporate industry along with their meanings.

"EMERGING DYNAMICS OF MANAGEMENT (hb) 2017","I am extremely delighted that Sirajuddin Aziz has decided to publish the anthology of his articles in the form of a volume. This is a remarkable effort on his part as he is fully preoccupied with the onerous responsibilities of running a well managed commercial bank. But this does not come to me as a surprise. He is one of the few banking professionals who has always devoted time to reading, reflecting and writing, and using those insights and knowledge for articulating and disseminating fresh ways of thinking and doing things. I hope this volume is widely distributed as it is, in my view, a MUST reading not only for the business schools but also for those going through mid career and executive education training. Dr Ishrat Hussain, Ex-Governor, State Bank of Pakistan,  Former Dean, Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Advisor to the Wilson International Centre for Scholars   I find immense pleasure and a lot of enjoyment reading Sirajuddin Aziz’s invaluable publications, be it in leadership, communication, human resource, personal development areas, etc…, just to name a few. The articles set a clear road map toward success and reaching the pinnacle of excellence. The flawless way of writing complemented by a beautiful presentation of the issues and positions at work either in the boardroom or at the desk are, of great value and a perfect piece of advice. Abdulla Al-Mutawa Member of the Board, Bank Alfalah Limited, Abu Dhabi, UAE  A very seasoned banker, Sirajuddin Aziz is an honest and forthright person with an excellent understanding and grasp over his subject matter. His well-researched articles on ‘Management’ and other topics in local newspapers and magazines are a credible guide to good and ethical banking practices, they are a must read for bankers and non-bankers alike. A soft spoken self-effacing person. Those with such extensive experience, ‘hands on’ management have seldom been effective in translating that knowledge to either a public or a classroom audience as well as Siraj has done. He has that rare gift of being an effective communicator. As his colleague on the board of a major bank for over a dozen years, one was fortunate to get to see this honest and thoroughly professional corporate giant at first hand. His competence and integrity being something to cherish for me personally, Siraj is a true role model for our young generation. Ikram Sehgal, Chairman, Path Finders Group of Companies, Defence Analyst Sirajuddin Aziz is a versatile, insightful analyst of core management dimensions. A rare example of one who has achieved sustained success but who generously shares lessons from experience. In a professional field that coldly abstains from emotion and empathy, he emerges as a compassionate, sensitive human being. Self-critical and candid where relevant, supplemented by wide reading, he uses humour and gentle yet firm strength of reason to engage and to persuade. This anthology is a very sound balance sheet … plus profit aplenty. Ex-Senator (R) Javed Jabbar  “The way to change others mind is with affection and not anger” — Dalai Lama.  The manifestation of this concept is in the person of Sirajuddin Aziz as well as his writings on various topics. His style to change the mind is very persuasive in all what he writes and what he says. His articles have introduced new meanings and dimensions to subjects I thought I knew fairly well. Sirajuddin is honest with others and with himself. He is slow to see the faults of others but quick to discover their goodness. Syed Mazhar Abbas, Director, Bank Al Habib Limited In Pakistan’s corporate world there are scores of champion leaders and gurus, but hardly few of them share and transfer their experiences, management insights and career lessons in writing, let alone in the form of a book. Sirajuddin Aziz belongs to that minuscule minority, he writes on a diverse range of issues, particularly about personal development and various facets of management challenges and their solutions. The way he produces an article almost every week for various publications despite his busy schedule, underlines not just his passion for words but also a disciplined life-style. This collection of Mr Aziz is a first of its kind by a Pakistani author — is a treasure trove not just for the aspiring young professionals belonging to the corporate world, but also for the mid and senior-level leaders. Amir Zia, SEVP BOL News Group  Ex-Senior Editor, The NEWS International  Author: Sirajuddin Aziz is a professionally qualified and experienced banker who has worked for different organizations in Pakistan, China, Hong Kong, U.K., Nigeria and U.A.E. He is currently the President & Chief Executive Officer at Habib Metropolitan Bank. Prior to this, he has served as the chief executive officer of a leading commercial bank in Pakistan. He has been actively involved in overseeing the entire spectrum of banking operations of various banks for over thirty years. Mr Aziz is a Fellow of Institute of Bankers Pakistan (IBP).  He is the editor of the journal of IBP for about a decade.  He is also a member of Pakistan Institute of International Affairs. He is a regular speaker at prestigious education institutes, universities and professional forums, where he conducts sessions on a diverse range of subjects comprising credit, trade & foreign exchange, code of governance, economy, professional etiquettes and personal development. Mr Aziz also participates in televised discussions on finance & economy.  Mr Aziz is a regular contributor to national and international dailies, journals and magazines.  He is an author, with published works comprising The Quest of Mirage, Saurab Ki Talaash Main (Urdu translation), Bitter & Sweet and The Essence of Islam.

"MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR INDUSTRIAL SAFETY HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT (pb)2010","Management Information System (MIS) is an integral part of modern day safety management functions and requires the same degree of thought and attention as the other management aspects. The system must be dynamic, evolving and continually improving, which can be made possible through effective monitoring of Safety Management System (SMS) by auditing and inspection.

Management Information System for Industrial Safety Health and Environment contains in-depth discussions on MIS aspects with respect to safety management activities including Hazard and Risk Management, Safety Education and Training, Work-environment Monitoring, Safety Performance Monitoring and Reporting, Gap Analysis and Continual Improvement. Appendices have been added in the book for additional information, besides practice checklists and formats, which will come handy for the students, practicing HSE professionals and managers. The book would also encourage professionals to use dynamic as well as modern Management Information System in the field of Health, Safety and Environment Management. The book discusses conformity assessment and non-conformity tracking methodologies which can be better carried out through a suitably implemented MIS. Document control and continuous improvement strategies have been deliberated following the ISO standards on Health & Safety (OHSAS-18001), and Environment (ISO-140001).

"INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RELEVANT THEORY AND INFORMED PRACTICE (hb)2004","In 1984, Working Group 8.2 of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) threw down the gauntlet at its Manchester conference, challenging the traditionalist orthodoxy with its uncommon research approaches and topics. Manchester 1984, followed by research methods conferences in Copenhagen (1990) and Philadelphia (1997), marked the growing legitimacy of the linguistic and qualitative turns in Information Systems research and played a key role in making qualitative methods a respected part of IS research. As evidenced by the papers in this volume, Working Group 8.2 conferences showcase fresh thinking, provocative sessions, and intellectual stimulation. The spirited, at times boisterous, and always enlivening debate has turned WG8.2 conferences into life-changing and discipline-changing inspirational events.

"BEAT THE ODDS: AVOID CORPORATE DEATH AND BUILD A RESILIENT ENTERPRISE 1e (hb)","Beat the Odds fills a crucial void in the current business literature. It clearly illustrates why great organizations slip from leader to follower to road-kill and how organizations can Beat the Odds and avoid this fate. This is a concise must-read for senior executives and for any manager interested in seeing his or her organization avoid corporate death and build for the future.  Over the past 10 years, there have been more than 600,000 business bankruptcies in the United States. Research findings confirm that the odds are very slim for any organization to survive more than a few decades. Many books that purport to offer secrets of business success only study companies that are currently successful. Other books provide pieces that dont fit together to solve the puzzle in real-world practice.  Beat the Odds evolved from a study of a broad pool of companies across a wide spectrum of performance over an extended period of time. The book presents a tested and comprehensive nine-part framework for understanding, building and ensuring long-term organizational success through the ups and downs of business cycles, competitive cycles and management cycles. Supported by real case studies, each of the nine framework elements includes a clear description of the underlying principles pertaining to both successful and dysfunctional behaviors.  The assessment and diagnostic tools provided in this book are designed to give managers deep insights into their firms underlying challenges and for performing their own gap analysis of where they are now, versus where they should be. It also features the factual basis for corrective action and prescriptive steps for immediate deployment of this framework.  Features Presents a tested and refined nine-part integrated and practical framework for understanding, building and ensuring organizational success, regardless of changing economic, financial, regulatory and technology factors Illustrates the validity, power and value of the nine principles using numerous real examples and shows the toxic effects of ignoring the principles. Features three inside stories (case studies) that illustrate how energized and aligned leadership teams can harness the framework to secure their organizations long-term success. Provides prescriptive steps for immediate deployment of this framework and its underlying principles. Includes mini-case studies for readers to gain practice using the diagnostic tools and to test their understanding of the framework before applying it to their own organization.

"CORPORATE FRAUD AND CORRUPTION (pb) 2016","Recent large-scale corporate collapses, such as Lehman Brothers, Enron, Worldcom, and Parmalat, highlight the implosion of traditional models of fraud prevention. By focusing on risk factors at the micro level, they have failed to take into account the broader context in which external auditors operate as well as the crucial importance of such factors as corruption, organizational culture, corporate social responsibility, ethical values, governance, ineffective regulation, and a lack of transparency. Corporate Fraud and Corruption engages readers by showing how evidence-based, multi-level micro and macro analysis of fraud risk and protective factors inform effective fraud prevention, in turn minimizing financial catastrophes. Krambia-Kapardis focuses on her own empirical research into the aetiology of fraud to showcase a holistic approach to fraud prevention. This book also features major case studies from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia.  Author: Maria Krambia-Kapardis is Associate Professor of Accounting at Cyprus University of Technology and Chair of Transparency International - Cyprus.

"ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE MIND (hb)2013","It's hard to conceive of a topic of more broad and personal interest than the study of the mind. In addition to its traditional investigation by the disciplines of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience, the mind has also been a focus of study in the fields of philosophy, economics, anthropology, linguistics, computer science, molecular biology, education, and literature. In all these approaches, there is an almost universal fascination with how the mind works and how it affects our lives and our behavior. Studies of the mind and brain have crossed many exciting thresholds in recent years, and the study of mind now represents a thoroughly cross-disciplinary effort. Researchers from a wide range of disciplines seek answers to such questions as: What is mind? How does it operate? What is consciousness?  This encyclopedia brings together scholars from the entire range of mind-related academic disciplines from across the arts and humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and computer science and engineering to explore the multidimensional nature of the human mind.

"THEORY OF STOCHASTIC OBJECTS: PROBABILITY STOCHASTIC PROCESSES AND INFERENCE (hb) 2018","Summary This book defines and investigates the concept of a random object. To accomplish this task in a natural way, it brings together three major areas; statistical inference, measure-theoretic probability theory and stochastic processes. This point of view has not been explored by existing textbooks; one would need material on real analysis, measure and probability theory, as well as stochastic processes - in addition to at least one text on statistics- to capture the detail and depth of material that has gone into this volume.  Presents and illustrates ‘random objects’ in different contexts, under a unified framework, starting with rudimentary results on random variables and random sequences, all the way up to stochastic partial differential equations. Reviews rudimentary probability and introduces statistical inference, from basic to advanced, thus making the transition from basic statistical modeling and estimation to advanced topics more natural and concrete. Compact and comprehensive presentation of the material that will be useful to a reader from the mathematics and statistical sciences, at any stage of their career, either as a graduate student, an instructor, or an academician conducting research and requiring quick references and examples to classic topics. Includes 378 exercises, with the solutions manual available on the book's website. 121 illustrative examples of the concepts presented in the text (many including multiple items in a single example).    The book is targeted towards students at the master’s and Ph.D. levels, as well as, academicians in the mathematics, statistics and related disciplines. Basic knowledge of calculus and matrix algebra is required. Prior knowledge of probability or measure theory is welcomed but not necessary.
