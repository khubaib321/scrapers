Description  Safeguarding Intangible Assets provides strategies for preserving and enhancing a company’s intangible assets to increase its profitability, competitiveness, and sustainability.   Intangible assets such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, methodologies, and brand typically account for 80 percent of an organization’s value and revenue. There are many forces making it more and more difficult to protect these assets, and securing them is a complex issue often overlooked by security and risk managers.

"BUILDING NEURAL NETWORKS (pb)1996","This practical introduction describes the kinds of real-world problems neural network technology can solve. Surveying a range of neural network applications, the book demonstrates the construction and operation of artificial neural systems. Through numerous examples, the author explains the process of building neural-network applications that utilize recent connectionist developments, and conveys an understanding both of the potential, and the limitations of different network models. Examples are described in enough detail for you to assimilate the information and then use the accumulated experience of others to create your own applications. These examples are deliberately restricted to those that can be easily understood, and recreated, by any reader, even the novice practitioner. In some cases the author describes alternative approaches to the same application, to allow you to compare and contrast their advantages and disadvantages.  Organized by application areas, rather than by specific network architectures or learning algorithms, Building Neural Networks shows why certain networks are more suitable than others for solving specific kinds of problems. Skapura also reviews principles of neural information processing and furnishes an operations summary of the most popular neural-network processing models. Finally, the book provides information on the practical aspects of application design, and contains six topic-oriented chapters on specific applications of neural-network systems. These applications include networks that perform:   -Pattern matching, storage, and recall.-Business and financial systems.-Data extraction from images.-Mechanical process control systems.-New neural networks that combine pattern matching with fuzzy logic.   The book includes application-oriented exercises that further help you see how a neural network solves a problem, and that reinforce your understanding of modeling techniques.  Author: David M. Skapura is the coauthor, with James A. Freeman, of Neural Networks: Algorithms, Applications, and Programming Techniques. He is currently employed by Brightware Corporation (a spin-off of Inference Corporation), where he works as an applications consultant, developing customized knowledge-based systems and applications. He is also the founder and president of Scient Computing, a small Houston consulting firm specializing in neural-networking applications and research. Previously at Loral Space Information Systems, Skapura investigated the applicability of neural networks to NASA's advanced automation requirements. He is an adjunct professor at the University of Houston at Clear Lake.","PKR 7,354.00","DAVID M.

"GAME DEVELOPER'S OPEN SOURCE HANDBOOK, 1e (pb)","With the cost of game development increasing regularly, studios are looking for innovative ways to reduce their budgets without compromising quality. At the same time, developers are looking toward more complex and customizable software, tools, and libraries to build truly next-generation games. These goals have traditionally been mutually exclusive, but open source software can solve both problems by providing game developers with free, high-quality tools and libraries for every aspect of the development process. Graphics, audio, physics, networking, and movie playback code are all available for the taking; developed, written, tested, and ready to use. This software is complemented by a wide range of end-user tools for both the programmer and artist including graphic editors, IDEs, MIDI sequencers, and 3D editors. The Game Developer's Open Source Handbook uncovers this world of open source software and teaches management and game developers what code is available, where to get it, how to incorporate it into existing processes, and, most important, how to adhere to the license agreements for redistribution.

"BIOMETRICS FOR NETWORK SECURITY (pb)2004","A very good and readable book about biometrics for network security. Note the network security part - the coverage is limited to systems that can be used in an everyday business environment. The book could be read by just about anyone, although it does help knowing a little bit about biometrics to start with. There are basically two main parts - the first one describes the different biometric technologies and their strengths and weaknesses. The second part discusses actual testing and deployment using real life examples of what to do and what not to do. I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who is actually going to implement a biometric system. Just knowing how the biometrics work is not enough to have a successful deployment. If you want to know the full details of how different biometric algorithms work, this book is probably not for you. The level of detail is just what you would take away from reading the detailed description, which I actually liked. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in network security.

"DIGITAL DIVIDE, THE (pb)2011","This definitive work on the perils and promise of the social- media revolution collects writings by today's best thinkers and cultural commentators, with an all-new introduction by Bauerlein.  Twitter, Facebook, e-publishing, blogs, distance-learning and other social media raise some of the most divisive cultural questions of our time. Some see the technological breakthroughs we live with as hopeful and democratic new steps in education, information gathering, and human progress. But others are deeply concerned by the eroding of civility online, declining reading habits, withering attention spans, and the treacherous effects of 24/7 peer pressure on our young.   With The Dumbest Generation, Mark Bauerlein emerged as the foremost voice against the development of an overwhelming digital social culture. But The Digital Divide doesn't take sides. Framing the discussion so that leading voices from across the spectrum, supporters and detractors alike, have the opportunity to weigh in on the profound issues raised by the new media-from questions of reading skills and attention span, to cyber-bullying and the digital playground- Bauerlein's new book takes the debate to a higher ground.   The book includes essays by Steven Johnson, Nicholas Carr, Don Tapscott, Douglas Rushkoff, Maggie Jackson, Clay Shirky, Todd Gitlin, and many more. Though these pieces have been previously published, the organization of The Digital Divide gives them freshness and new relevancy, making them part of a single document readers can use to truly get a handle on online privacy, the perils of a plugged-in childhood, and other technology-related hot topics.

"ONTOLOGY ENGINEERING IN A NETWORKED WORLD (hb) 2012","The Semantic Web is characterized by the existence of a very large number of distributed semantic resources, which together define a network of ontologies. These ontologies in turn are interlinked through a variety of different meta-relationships such as versioning, inclusion, and many more. This scenario is radically different from the relatively narrow contexts in which ontologies have been traditionally developed and applied, and thus calls for new methods and tools to effectively support the development of novel network-oriented semantic applications.  This book by Suárez-Figueroa et al. provides the necessary methodological and technological support for the development and use of ontology networks, which ontology developers need in this distributed environment. After an introduction, in its second part the authors describe the NeOn Methodology framework. The book’s third part details the key activities relevant to the ontology engineering life cycle. For each activity, a general introduction, methodological guidelines, and practical examples are provided. The fourth part then presents a detailed overview of the NeOn Toolkit and its plug-ins. Lastly, case studies from the pharmaceutical and the fishery domain round out the work.  The book primarily addresses two main audiences: students (and their lecturers) who need a textbook for advanced undergraduate or graduate courses on ontology engineering, and practitioners who need to develop ontologies in particular or Semantic Web-based applications in general. Its educational value is maximized by its structured approach to explaining guidelines and combining them with case studies and numerous examples. The description of the open source NeOn Toolkit provides an additional asset, as it allows readers to easily evaluate and apply the ideas presented.

"SECURITY IN COMPUTING 5e","This book offers complete coverage of all aspects of computer security, including users, software, devices, operating systems, networks, law, and ethics. Reflecting rapidly evolving attacks, countermeasures, and computing environments, it introduces up-to-the-minute best practices for authenticating users, preventing malicious code execution, using encryption, protecting privacy, implementing firewalls, detecting intrusions, and more. Features  • This classic text has been thoroughly updated to reflect today’s newest technologies, standards, and trends • Topics progress from simple and straightforward to complex and intricate • Easy-to-read descriptions of concepts and incidents • As of Oct, 2015, there are new, vastly improved PowerPoint slides for instructor use New to this Edition  Cryptography is critical to computer security; it is an essential tool that students and professionals must know, appreciate and understand. But as with most tools, the user does not need to be a maker: using a screwdriver successfully is entirely separate from knowing how to forge the metal from which it is made. This edition will separate the use of cryptography from its underlying mathematical principles. It will introduce cryptography early in the book to provide a solid background on types of algorithms, appropriate uses of these different types, and advanced concepts such as digital signatures and cryptographic hash codes. It will also address how cryptography can fail. However, it will cover these topics without revealing the internals of cryptography; closer to the end of the book it will delve into the internals of specific algorithms. In this way, readers who want to know the details can study those (and can even read the later chapter early, out of the normal sequence), but it will not unnecessarily burden readers who, like most users, will never get closer to cryptography than an encrypt() function. One strength of SiC4 has been its sidebars. Readers enjoy the brief examples of real life exploits. Fortunately, the news is full of stories of security failures, and it is important to connect these actual events to the strong pedagogy of the book. ACS, which was organized around attacks of different types, include many timely incident stories that we can pull into SiC5. Cloud computing and mobile code and computing are not covered extensively in SiC4. Cloud computing appears as a six page interlude in ACS, but in the few years since ACS was written, the use of cloud computing has expanded, as well as the security ramifications. We intend to devote an entire chapter to cloud computing. Similarly, mobile code and mobile computing have grown. These topics appeared briefly in SiC4 and ACS, but we plan to expand mobile computing into its own chapter, as well. The topic progression of SiC4 largely followed its predecessor editions, back to the first edition (1988). In 1988 networking was certainly neither as important nor pervasive as it has become. Trying to defer all coverage of network topics until Chapter 7, its position in SiC4 delays important content significantly and, perhaps more importantly, makes for a long and broad network security chapter. In 1988 readers had less direct contact with a network than now, and these readers had limited experience using a network prior to reading the book. Obviously readers in 2014 come with vastly more network exposure. This exposure is an asset: Readers now can appreciate  a network-delivered attack even before they study network security. SiC5 will take advantage of readers’ familiarity with networks, and present attacks delivered by a network-assisted attacker based on the primary source of vulnerability—software, operating system, protocol, user error—and not defer these topics to the networks chapter just because a network was involved in the attack. Finally, privacy has been an important topic in the book in early editions, and its importance and coverage have grown as well. The authors will again expand the coverage of privacy, expanding on topics such as web tracking and social networking. These additions cannot come without some pruning. Previously hot topics, such as trusted operating systems and multilevel databases, are being pared down. The authors will also reconsider topics such as economics and management which, although interesting and important, appeal to a relatively small target audience.

"DATA PROTECTION: ENSURIGN DATA AVAILABILITY (pb)2017","Features  Explains data deduplication Describes how to protect a virtual infrastructure Focuses on data recovery strategies in the age of big data Highlights how and why data recovery processes are integral to IT governance  Summary This is the fundamental truth about data protection: backup is dead. Or rather, backup and recovery, as a standalone topic, no longer has relevance in IT. As a standalone topic, it’s been killed off by seemingly exponential growth in storage and data, by the cloud, and by virtualization.  So what is data protection?  This book takes a holistic, business-based approach to data protection. It explains how data protection is a mix of proactive and reactive planning, technology and activities that allow for data continuity. It shows how truly effective data protection comes from a holistic approach considering the entire data lifecycle and all required SLAs. Data protection is neither RAID nor is it continuous availability, replication, snapshots or backups—it is all of them, combined in a considered and measured approach to suit the criticality of the data and meet all the requirements of the business.  The book also discusses how businesses seeking to creatively leverage their IT investments and to drive through cost optimization are increasingly looking at data protection as a mechanism to achieve those goals. In addition to being a type of insurance policy, data protection is becoming an enabler for new processes around data movement and data processing.  This book arms readers with information critical for making decisions on how data can be protected against loss in the cloud, on-premises, or in a mix of the two. It explains the changing face of recovery in a highly virtualized data center and techniques for dealing with big data. Moreover, it presents a model for where data recovery processes can be integrated with IT governance and management in order to achieve the right focus on recoverability across the business.

"DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING USING MATLAB 2e (pb) 2006","This supplement to any standard DSP text is one of the first books to successfully integrate the use of MATLAB[registered] in the study of DSP concepts. In this book, MATLAB[registered] is used as a computing tool to explore traditional DSP topics, and solve problems to gain insight. This greatly expands the range and complexity of problems that students can effectively study in the course. Since DSP applications are primarily algorithms implemented on a DSP processor or software, a fair amount of programming is required. Using interactive software such as MATLAB[registered] makes it possible to place more emphasis on learning new and difficult concepts than on programming algorithms. Interesting practical examples are discussed and useful problems are explored. This updated second edition includes new homework problems and revises the scripts in the book, available functions, and m-files to MATLAB[registered] V7.

"ENGINEERING ETHICS: CONCEPTS AND CASES, 4e (pb) 2008","Extend your analytical skills to moral deliberation with this best-selling engineering ethics text. ENGINEERING ETHICS: CONCEPTS AND CASES, 4E International Edition bridges the gap between theory and practice with more than 200 current case studies available in the text and on the companion website, including current and controversial topics, such as Hurricane Katrina and global warming. This edition introduces you to a proven, structured methodology for analyzing cases, as well as examples of cases that already have been analyzed, to ensure you can practice ethical engineering yourself. The text also discusses Engineering Codes of Ethics. You'll learn the importance of critical moral reasoning as the book demonstrates how many apparent moral disagreements are actually disagreements about the facts or the definitions of crucial terms. Significant topics, such as the ethical theory and the consequences of whistle-blowing, are now covered in greater depth.

With the growth in the size and complexity of software projects and the corresponding design and development effort involved, the importance of formal software project management cannot be overemphasized.   This book, in its second edition, comprehensively presents the essentials of theory and practice of software project management methodologies. The aim is to introduce the readers to the subject in a conceptual framework. The topics included in this edition are updated as per the ongoing trends in the field of software project management.   New to This Edition :   An appendix on Metrics and Measurements   A list of abbreviations at the beginning of chapters   The book is well-suited for teaching an academic course of one semester or for conducting short training programmes for software engineers and project managers.

Book starts with basic architecture interview questions and the covers OOP, UML, Design Patterns, SOA, load balancing and Estimation sections.  Design patterns is one the most asked section when you go for an architect position. A complete chapter with 30 patterns does full justice to this section. We have also shipped sample code for all 30 design patterns.   Design document is one of the biggest deliverable from a technical architect. No design document is complete with out UML diagrams and no technical architect interview will be complete with out UML. A complete chapter on UML diagrams will upgrade you in few hours to face any kind of UML questions.   SOA is of the popular section in every architect interview. A dedicated chapter on SOA covering ESB, WS -, Governance etc does full justice to this section. A technical architect is not supposed to handle project management activities in ideal world, but he will always be a part of the estimation section of the project during project proposal. Nice and sweet chapter on estimation covering function points, use case points and COCOMO does full justice to the estimation section. Even though OOP is basic many architects fail to answer them. It's mandatory that a technical architect should be able to answer all OOP interview questions. We have dedicated a complete chapter for OOP which covers the most asked question in OOP.  The best part of the book is other than technical aspect it also covers points regarding salary negotiation, salary break ups according to industry standards, resume making ( with a sample resume) , interview rating sheet ,salary standards and common IT HR questions for technical architects.

"INVENTING THE MEDIUM: PRINCIPLES OF INTERACTION DESIGN AS A CULTURAL PRACTICE (hb)2012","Digital artifacts from iPads to databases pervade our lives, and the design decisions that shape them affect how we think, act, communicate, and understand the world. But the pace of change has been so rapid that technical innovation is outstripping design. Interactors are often mystified and frustrated by their enticing but confusing new devices; meanwhile, product design teams struggle to articulate shared and enduring design goals. With Inventing the Medium, the author provides a unified vocabulary and a common methodology for the design of digital objects and environments. It is be an essential guide for both students and practitioners in the evolving field of interaction design.   The author explains that innovative interaction designers should think of all objects made with bits—whether games or Web pages, robots or the latest killer apps—as belonging to a single new medium: the digital medium. Designers can speed the process of useful and lasting innovation by focusing on the collective cultural task of inventing this new medium. Exploring strategies for maximizing the expressive power of digital artifacts, Murray identifies and examines four representational affordances of digital environments that provide the core palette for designers across applications: computational procedures user participation, navigable space, and encyclopedic capacity.   Each chapter includes a set of Design Explorations—creative exercises for students and thought experiments for practitioners— that allow readers to apply the ideas in the chapter to particular design problems. Inventing the Medium also provides more than 200 illustrations of specific design strategies drawn from multiple genres and platforms and a glossary of design concepts.   Author  JANET H.

"THE BUSINESS VALUE OF AGILE SOFTWARE METHODS: MAXIMUM ROI WITH JUST- IN-TIME PROCESSES AND DOCUMENTATION, 1e (hb)2014","Whether to continue using traditional cost and benefit analysis methods such as systems and software engineering standards or to use a relatively new family of software development processes known as Agile methods is one of most prevalent questions within the information technology field today. Since each family of methods has its strengths and weaknesses, the question being raised by a growing number of executives and practitioners is: Which family of methods provides the greater business value and return on investment (ROI)? Whereas traditional methods have been in use for many decades, Agile methods are still a new phenomenon and, until now, very little literature has existed on how to quantify the business value of Agile methods in economic terms, such as ROI and net present value (NPV).   Using cost of quality, total cost of ownership, and total life cycle cost parameters, The Business Value of Agile Software Methods offers a comprehensive methodology and introduces the industry's initial top-down parametric models for quantifying the costs and benefits of using Agile methods to create innovative software products. Based on real-world data, it illustrates the first simple-to-use parametric models of Real Options for estimating the business value of Agile methods since the inception of the Nobel prize-winning Black-Scholes formula. Numerous examples on how to estimate the costs, benefits, ROI, NPV, and real options of the major types of Agile methods such as Scrum, Extreme Programming and Crystal Methods are also included. In addition, this reference provides the first comprehensive compilation of cost and benefit data on Agile methods from an analysis of hundreds of research studies.     The Business Value of Agile Software Methods shatters key myths and misconceptions surrounding the modern-day phenomenon of Agile methods for creating software products. It provides a complete business value comparison between traditional and Agile methods. The keys to maximizing the business value of any method are low costs and high benefits and the business value of Agile methods, when compared to traditional methods, proves to be very impressive. Agile methods are a new model of project management that can be used to improve the success, business value, and ROI of high-risk and highly complex IT projects in today's dynamic, turbulent, and highly uncertain marketplace. If you are an executive, manager, scholar, student, consultant or practitioner currently on the fence, you need to read this book!  Author:  Dr. David F. Rico Dr. David F.

"PERL MEDIC: TRANSFORMING LEGACY CODE","This book is about taking over Perl code, whether written by someone else or by yourself at an earlier time. Developers regularly estimate that they spend 60 to 80 percent of their time working with existing code. Many problems of code inheritance are common to all languages, but the nature of the language makes Perl especially tricky. The reason why is that Perl is similar to English - bursting with irregular verbs, consistent only when it's convenient, borrowing terms from other languages, and providing many ways to say the same thing. In fact, Perl developers have a motto with the abbreviation TMTOWTDI: There's More Than One Way To Do It. While this flexibility is one of the language's strengths, it also makes it extremely difficult when you are faced with an existing piece of code. There are millions of lines of Perl code being used all over the Web; much of it was built on an ad hoc basis, the creators never imagining that the code would still be in use months or years later. This book will be the resource all Perl programmers need to understand someone else's code, even when it's bad; repair it; convert it to a better style; upgrade it to the latest version of Perl; maintain it; and find and fix its bugs.

"PRO SILVERLIGHT 4 IN VB 3e(pb)2011","Presented with copious graphics and screenshots provide the clearest possible explanation of Silverlight 4’s highly visual tools and output. Builds on the proven success of this book and adds full coverage of the technology’s new features. Written by Matthew MacDonald, an author with a strong track record of producing industry-leading Silverlight, ASP and WPF books going back many years.  Silverlight is Microsoft's cross-browser technology for creating rich user experiences on the Web. Like its predecessor, Silverlight 4 rides atop the .NET framework for maximum ease of use and coding efficiency. The technology carries forward much of the work that has been done before and augments it in many important respects, including support for H.264 video, major improvements to the graphics engine (including true 3D rendering), and much richer data-binding options for interfacing with other applications.  Pro Silverlight 4 in VB is an invaluable reference for professional developers who want to discover the features of Silverlight. Author Matthew MacDonald's expert advice guides you through creating rich media applications using Silverlight in the environment you're most productive in—no matter what the target platform. As you learn about the features that put Silverlight in direct competition with Adobe Flash, such as rich support for 2D and 3D drawing, animations, and media playback, you'll experience the plumbing of .NET and the design model of WPF through Silverlight—all of the same .NET technology that developers use to design next-generation Windows applications.   In this book, MacDonald provides a comprehensive tutorial written from professional developer to professional developer.

"ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE STEP BY STEP: PROGRAMMING WITH LINUX 3e(pb)2011","By starting with a complete, accessible picture of the internal operations of PCs, presenting a systematic approach to the process of writing, testing, and debugging programs in assembly language, and providing how-to information for using procedures and macros, this third edition offers beginners and intermediate programmers a solid and comprehensive understanding of how to cope with the complexity of assembly programming. In the past four or five years, Ubuntu Linux has emerged as the best-supported and most widely used Linux distro, and Linux differs from Windows in that simple terminal apps may easily be created in assembly. All the tutorial material in this edition has been recast for Ubuntu Linux. The NASM assembler is still available (and much improved!) and will be retained. The portable and widely used Eclipse IDE system can be used with NASM and will be used for all tutorial presentations. The gcc compiler used for linking and gdb for debugging. Both utilities are shipped with Ubuntu Linux and are very widely used. Linux itself is written in gcc. All software mentioned in the book is downloadable without charge from the Internet.  About The Author:  Jeff Duntemann is the former Editor-in-Chief of Visual Developer magazine, Turbo Technix and PC Techniques, and the Structured Programming columnist for Dr. Dobb's Journal as well as the co-founder of the former Coriolis Publishing. He first learned assembly language while developing interrupt-driven communication software for the Z-80 and later the x86 processor, while on staff at Xerox Corporation. He has written extensively about assembly code interface from high-level languages, and has written and edited several books on assembly coding and optimization.

"A GUIDE TO SELECTING SOFTWARE MEASURES AND METRICS (hb) 2017","Going where no book on software measurement and metrics has previously gone, this critique thoroughly examines a number of bad measurement practices, hazardous metrics, and huge gaps and omissions in the software literature that neglect important topics in measurement. The book covers the major gaps and omissions that need to be filled if data about software development is to be useful for comparisons or estimating future projects. Among the more serious gaps are leaks in reporting about software development efforts that, if not corrected, can distort data and make benchmarks almost useless and possibly even harmful. One of the most common leaks is that of unpaid overtime. Software is a very labor-intensive occupation, and many practitioners work very long hours. However, few companies actually record unpaid overtime. This means that software effort is underreported by around 15%, which is too large a value to ignore. Other sources of leaks include the work of part-time specialists who come and go as needed. There are dozens of these specialists, and their combined effort can top 45% of total software effort on large projects. The book helps software project managers and developers uncover errors in measurements so they can develop meaningful benchmarks to estimate software development efforts. It examines variations in a number of areas that include:  Programming languages Development methodology Software reuse Functional and nonfunctional requirements Industry type Team size and experience Filled with tables and charts, this book is a starting point for making measurements that reflect current software development practices and realities to arrive at meaningful benchmarks to guide successful software projects.

"FIRST COURSE IN DIGITAL SYSTEMS DESIGN: INTEGRATED APPROACH, 1e (hb) 2000","This book provides a new paradigm for teaching digital systems design. It puts forth the view that modern digital logic consists of several interacting areas that combine in a cohesive fashion. This includes traditional subjects such as Boolean algebra, logic formalisms, Karnaugh maps, and other classical topics. However, it goes beyond these subject areas by including VHDL, CMOS, VLSI and RISC architectures to show what the field looks like to a modern logic designer. Modern digital design is no longer practiced as a stand-alone art. The integrated approach used in this book is designed to ensure that graduating engineers are prepared to meet the challenges of the new century.  Author: John P.

"THE ITSM PROCESS DESIGN GUIDE: DEVELOPING REENGINEERING, ANG IMPROVING IT SERVICE MANAGEMENT, 1e (hb)","IT organizations increasingly recognize the need to design, re-design, and improve their internal IT service management (ITSM) processes. While popular frameworks such as the IT Infrastructure Library&trade (ITIL®), Control Objectives for IT (COBIT®), Microsoft® Operations Framework (MOF), and the ISO/IEC 20000 standard describe what to do, they do not describe the mechanics of how to do it. The ITSM Process Design Guide: Developing, Rengineering and Improving IT Service Management closes the knowledge gap by providing detailed guidance on assessing, designing, measuring, and integrating ITSM processes. The advice and techniques in this book apply unilaterally to every IT service provider and ITSM framework, standard, and maturity model.

"MAKE: GETTING STARTED WITH 3D CARVING - FIVE STEP-BY-STEP PROJECTS TO LAUNCH YOU ON YOUR MAKER JOURNEY (pb) 2017","This book was written for people who have never used a 3D carving machine. It teaches the basics of designing and making things with Inventables' software (Easel) and 3D carving machines (X-Carve and Carvey). We'll take you step-by-step through five projects you can build yourself as a beginner: an inspiration tile, kitchen cutting board, custom block stamp, fidget spinner, and balsa wood glider. The book also features aspirational projects from makers in the community, like an electric guitar, to show what is possible through 3D carving. The design files and instructions for projects - ranging from beginner to expert - can be found on the Inventables website.

"DISCRETE SIMULATION AND ANIMATION FOR MINING ENGINEERS (pb) 2017","General Purpose Simulation System (GPSS) is a special computer programming language primarily used to simulate what can be classified as discrete systems. A discrete system is one where, at any given instant in time, a countable number of things can take place. The basic operation of a mine itself can be considered such a system.  Discrete Simulation and Animation for Mining Engineers explains how to model mining systems using GPSS/H® and PROOF® by Wolverine Software Corporation. Employing a unique approach that encourages engagement from the start, the text discusses animation first, and then slowly introduces simulation language. As each new topic is covered, an animation is provided to illustrate the key concepts.  Leveraging valuable insight gained from the author’s extensive experience modeling mines around the world, the book: Describes how to apply discrete system simulation to mines Shows how to make those simulations come alive with animation  Includes real-world examples and exercises that hone practical problem-solving skills Written by a mining engineer for mining engineers and students of mining, Discrete Simulation and Animation for Mining Engineers offers a comprehensive yet accessible treatment of mine simulation and animation useful in increasing the efficiency of industrial mining processes.

"COMPRESSIVE SENSING OF EARTH OBSERVATIONS (hb) 2017","Future remote sensing systems will make extensive use of Compressive Sensing (CS) as it becomes more integrated into the system design with increased high resolution sensor developments and the rising earth observation data generated each year. Written by leading experts in the field Compressive Sensing of Earth Observations provides a comprehensive and balanced coverage of the theory and applications of CS in all aspects of earth observations. This work covers a myriad of practical aspects such as the use of CS in detection of human vital signs in a cluttered environment and the corresponding modeling of rib-cage breathing. Readers are also presented with three different applications of CS to the ISAR imaging problem, which includes image reconstruction from compressed data, resolution enhancement, and image reconstruction from incomplete data.   About the Author  Chi Hau Chen (IEEE Life Fellow 2003, IEEE Fellow 1988) received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Purdue University in 1965. He has been a faculty member with the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMass Dartmouth) since1968 where he is currently Chancellor Professor Emeritus. Dr. Chen was the Associate Editor of IEEE Trans. on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing from 1982 to 1986, Associate Editor on information processing of IEEE Trans. on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 1985 to 2000.

"ADVANCED HIGH DYNAMIC RAGE IMAGING, 2e (hb) 2018","This book explores the methods needed for creating and manipulating HDR content. HDR is a step change from traditional imaging; more closely matching what we see with our eyes. In the years since the first edition of this book appeared, HDR has become much more widespread, moving from a research concept to a standard imaging method. This new edition incorporates all the many developments in HDR since the first edition and once again emphasizes practical tips, including the authors' popular HDR Toolbox (available on the authors' website) for MATLAB and gives readers the tools they need to develop and experiment with new techniques for creating compelling HDR content.  Features Contains the HDR Toolbox for readers' experimentation on authors' website  Offers an up-to-date, detailed guide to the theory and practice of high dynamic range imaging  Covers all aspects of the field, from capture to display  Provides benchmarks for evaluating HDR imagery  Author: Francesco Banterle, Alessandro Artusi, Kurt Debattista, Alan Chalmers Francesco Banterle is affiliated with Visual Computing Lab ISTI-CNR Alessandro Artusi is affiliated with the University of Girona Kurt Debattista and Alan Chalmers are affiliated with the University of Warwick","PKR 16,017.00","FRANCESCO BANTERLE",9781498706940,2018,"COMPUTER SCIENCE > WEB DESIGNING / GRAPHICS",2,"Hard Cover",English,328,images/books/9781498706940.jpg,http://paramountbooks.com.pk/loginindex.asp?isbn=9781498706940&opt=3&sUBcAT=03
