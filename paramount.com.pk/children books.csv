Illustrated step-by-step instructions will help kids --- and parents --- turn their backyards into regular bird havens!

"SECOND FIDDLE (pb)2005","Aspiring writer, Mags Clarke has just moved with her mother to a new area after the death of her father. One day she stumbles across a girl who appears to be floating above the trees while playing her violin in the woods.
