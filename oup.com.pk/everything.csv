Intikhab-e-Kalam: Syed Muhammad Jafari,"This is a representative selection of Syed Muhammad Jafari’s poems. Jafari was an Urdu language poet well known for his humorous and satirical verse. His hilarious poetry recitals at 'mushaeras' had made him very popular and his periodic appearances on TV had sent his popularity skyrocketing. But he could not collect his poetical works in book form and it was published some 10 years after his death. With publication of his second collection of poetry, Jafari's art was even more appreciated by readers and critics alike. Jafari’s wit and repartee made him hugely popular was his wit and repartee. Politicians, bureaucrats, and pseudo-religious figures were the butt of his satire. This selection from his works covers the more popular and better known poems, making it a truly hilarious critique of society.

Widows and Daughters,"This book outlines the so-called &lsquo;contemporary Asian matriarchate&rsquo;. In the twentieth century, six women have held the office of prime minister in South Asia. The pioneers were Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the world&rsquo;s first female prime minister, and Indira Gandhi, who headed the Government of India. They were followed by Benazir Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Begum Khaleda Zia, holders of the same position in Bangladesh, and Chandrika Kumaratunga, the Sri Lankan President. Why should countries so long associated with patriarchy and the subordination of women be the focus for so many politically prominent females? The analysts attribute it simply to inheritance as each of these women was a widow or daughter of a slain male national leader. Women have tended to move into top position of power under the most dramatic circumstances&mdash;as a result of military coups, attempted murder, and assassination. This book tries to unravel the question of how these six women have managed to take power and how they have been able to exploit to their benefit the traditions of sexuality, motherhood, and kinship in South Asia.

Talmeehat,"Talmeehaat means 'Allusions' figures of speech or litrary devices referringindirectly or in an implied manner to an object, a historic event, figure, legend, or personality. Allusions play a vital role in eastern literary traditions and are used in abundance in Arabic, Persian, Hindi and Urdu literary texts. Since in Urdu literature the readers, especially the young ones, may not be fully aware of the objects or figures that are alluded to, some sort of explanatory notes/guidance are often needed. This book, first published some 90 years ago, is still relevant today and has some rare allusions richly and finely explained as it includes all the relevant allusions used in Urdu including the ones taken form Persian, Arabic, and Hindi.   The foreword and the annotations of this volume, both penned by Dr Rauf Parekh, introduce the reader to the allusions, the original work, and the author in a reader friendly manner.

Iqbal Hasan Burney was born in 1926 in Bulandshahr, India. He completed his graduate studies from Aligarh University and obtained his Master&rsquo;s in Journalism from Stanford University, USA. After Partition in 1947, Burney became Chief Correspondent for APP (Associated Press of Pakistan). He also worked for the Morning News, Dawn, and Pakistan Observer. In 1962, Burney started the weekly Outlook in an attempt to create space for intellectually stimulating dialogues. While the weekly was received with great enthusiasm by the nation&rsquo;s intellectual community, the venture turned out to be short-lived; in 1964 it was forced to shut down by the Ayub government. In 1972, Burney revived Outlook under the Bhutto regime in the hope that it will enjoy the benefits of constitutional protection of freedom of expression. However, this hope too was shattered when Outlook was banned again on 20 July 1974 following Bhutto&rsquo;s accusation of the magazine having gone too far.  

Burney was a committed journalist, and a founding member of the Karachi Press Club that was established in 1958.  

I. H. Burney passed away in Karachi on 26 February 1993.

The Charismatic Leader Second Edition,"Based on the concept of charisma formulated by Max Weber and developed by recent writers, this second revised edition concentrates on &lsquo;personality-related&rsquo; and &lsquo;situational&rsquo; factors that led to the emergence of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah as the charismatic leader of Muslim India and sustained and strengthened him in that role to help create the separate state of Pakistan. While a few authors have dubbed Jinnah as a charismatic leader, hardly any one has defined or discussed the concept of charisma methodically or employed it systematically to analyse his charisma and charismatic leadership. In this sense, the present study is distinct and makes an original and unique contribution to the scholarly literature on Jinnah&rsquo;s political leadership. Dr Roger D. Long, a distinguished American historian on South Asia, thus acknowledged: &lsquo;Dr Hayat&rsquo;s analysis of Jinnah as a charismatic figure fills an important lacuna in the field&rsquo;. Hence, this study will help interested, informed readers to see Jinnah in a new, fuller, and refreshing light. They will see a new Jinnah: The Charismatic Leader!

It contains anecdotes and reminiscences about the people who shaped the entertainment industry, as well as interviews with directors and producers. But alongside the trivia is a clever synthesis juxtaposing the artistic development of the cinematic world with the overall social development in the country. It shows how the narrow self-interest of the ruling clique clashed with the creative potential of the artistic world, stifling originality and all but destroying the film industry. The narrative is punctuated with over a hundred photographs and contains an index of all the films made to date.

Defiance of the Rose,"The ebullience and vigour that famously marked the person of Perveen Shakir shines through in her work as well. This curation of hundred poems showcases her flair in a diverse poetic palette. On one end of the spectrum, we have poems that read like an open book, such as &lsquo;Moon&rsquo; and &lsquo; Echo&rsquo;. On the other end, there are more complex pieces, which unlock their meaning more reluctantly, such as the beguilingly titled &lsquo;Tomato Ketchup&rsquo;, which marches steadily on to its startling conclusion, and the endlessly nuanced &lsquo;Those with the Memory of Camels&rsquo;, which unveils a new shade upon every reading.  

Also included in this collection are some insightful and astutely observed portraits of ordinary men and women in society as well as well-known figures. Rendered with the lightness of a water colour, their readability draws us in, and makes it all the more impactful when the final irony of their situation strikes at closure.  

All said and done, her signature poems will, perhaps, always remain the ones in which she explores the full spectrum of feminine experience without apology, from its pleasures to its ordeals, and the range of roles it encompasses. Beyond any simplistic black and white notions of feminism and its implied denials, her embrace of womanhood is courageous and nuanced, comfortable with all its inherent contradictions, and revelling in every shade of its experience.  

The hallmark of her work is her poetic style &ndash; simple, and crisp. Her verse maintains an airiness and ease of touch at all times. Even when the realms she explores are inky and opaque, her words never become obtuse (&lsquo;Macbeth&rsquo;, &lsquo;An Unearthly Night&rsquo;). Similarly, in her shorter, tauter poems, where she plays with the gymnastics of a single sentence, the acrobatics of form do not eclipse the message, and these short pieces strike with the spontaneity of an overheard snippet from a conversation (&lsquo;Tantrum&rsquo;, &lsquo;Reorienting Focus&rsquo;).
Author Description

Journey into Europe,"Akbar Ahmed&rsquo;s profound and careful inquiries have greatly enriched our understanding of Islam in the modern world. His latest study, based on direct research with a group of young scholars, explores the complex interfaith reality of Europe, both in history and today, from an Eastern perspective, reversing the familiar paradigm. It is sure to be yet another influential contribution, one greatly needed in a world riven by conflicts and misunderstanding.  

Dr Noam Chomsky, Institute Professor and Professor of Linguistics (Emeritus), Massachusetts Institute of Technology  

This book is essential reading to all who want to understand our world. As a South Asian Christian, I can say with pride: South Asia has produced two Akbars&mdash;Akbar the Great, the emperor who united India, and Akbar Ahmed, who brings peace and harmony among nations through research and knowledge. Akbar, who I have known for decades, is my brother and my hero. He belongs to all of humanity. Long live the passion of Akbar to see one harmonious world with animosity and hatred for none.  

Councillor Dr James Shera MBE, S.Pk., Former Mayor of Rugby, England, Freeman of the Borough of Rugby, and Distinguished Formanite  

I don&rsquo;t exaggerate when I say that today Akbar Ahmed is the most knowledgeable scholar writing on Islam and the way the religion is affecting global affairs. In his extensive coverage of the subject, he has brought new insights policymakers in the West would do well to understand. In my own work what I have found most helpful is Professor Ahmed&rsquo;s finding that Islam&rsquo;s appeal to some of the extremist elements in Muslim societies should be understood in the context of the survival of tribalism in the structure and value systems of some of the societies that are contributing recruits to Islamist causes. In dealing with these dissidents, the use of force is not the preferred solution. What would work ultimately is the development and modernization of these societies.

The Economy of Modern Sindh,"The Economy of Modern Sindh delves into the different aspects of Sindh&rsquo;s economy&mdash;from geography, topography, climate, administrative history, and demographics, to the political landscape, education, health, labour force and employment, poverty and inequality, agriculture and water issues, infrastructure, industries, energy resources, and public finances&mdash;each is covered in a separate chapter. The book highlights the socioeconomic problems that have beset Sindh, arresting the province&rsquo;s economic potential, and proposes a multi-pronged strategy to address these challenges. It offers an incisive and objective assessment of the various policies enacted and pursued by the Sindh government over the years. It also attempts to identify the particular issues that require reforms at the sectoral and micro level. The analysis on each aspect of Sindh&rsquo;s economy is juxtaposed with the performance analysis at the national level as well as a comparison with Punjab that allows for a relative appraisal of Sindh&rsquo;s socioeconomic standing.

Governing the Ungovernable,"Pakistan, since its independence in 1947, had to face tumultuous years for the first four decades. Despite the many challenges, both internal and external, the country was able to register a 6 percent average annual growth rate during the first forty years of its existence. The country was ahead of India and Bangladesh in all economic and social indicators. Since 1990, the country has fallen behind its neighbouring countries and has had a decline in the growth rate.  

This book attempts to examine the reasons behind this slowdown, the volatile and inequitable growth of the last twenty-five years, and through a process of theoretical and empirical evidence argues that the most powerful explanatory hypothesis lies in the decay of institutions of governance. It also suggests a selective and incremental approach of restructuring some key public institutions that pertain to accountability, transparency, security, economic growth, and equity.

Jinnah of Pakistan,"Mohammad Ali Jinnah was for Pakistan what Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru combined were for modern India&mdash;inspirational father and first head of state. Jinnah began his career as the Indian National Congress&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ambassador of Hindu-Muslim Unity&rsquo; but ended it forty years later as the architect of the partition that split Pakistan away from India. This authoritative and uniquely insightful biography explores the fascinating public and private life of this eminently powerful but little understood leader who changed the map of the Asian subcontinent.  

Portraying Jinnah&rsquo;s story in all of its human complexity. Wolpert begins in the late nineteenth century with Jinnah&rsquo;s early life as a provincial country-boy in Karachi and follows him to London where he studied law and became a British barrister. Returning to India in 1896, Jinnah rapidly ascended the dual ladders of Indian law and politics, climbing to the top rung of each. By the 1920s, however, it appeared that Jinnah&rsquo;s political career was at an end, superseded by the rise of Gandhi&rsquo;s leadership and the movement of India in a more revolutionary direction. Yet, Jinnah was to remain a pivotal figure in the turbulent decades that followed, as India struggled for independence from British rule amid growing Hindu-Muslim antagonism.  

Wolpert vividly recounts how the tragic clash of personalities and party platforms that initially pitted Jinnah against Gandhi escalated from a personal rivalry into a conflict of national and international proportions. Wolpert shows how Jinnah&rsquo;s shrewd and skillful leadership combined brilliant advocacy and singular tenacity to win his suit for the creation of Pakistan on behalf of the &lsquo;Muslim nation&rsquo;&mdash;his sole client during the last, lonely, pain-filled decade of his life.

Pakistan: Beyond the ‘Crisis State’,"Pakistan’s diversity and resilience have rarely figured in the single-issue focus of recent literature on the country. This book presents an alternate paradigm and a deeper understanding of the country’s dynamics through an analysis of the Pakistan’s political, economic, social, foreign policy and governance challenges. It also discusses the complex interplay between domestic developments and external factors including great power interests that are so central to the Pakistan story and explain the vicissitudes in its fortunes.    ‘An excellent book, one that brings out some very important points about the surprising stability of the country beneath the alarmism of the daily headlines, and forms a useful antidote to the general perception about Pakistan in the West.’  Professor Anatol Lieven, King’s College, London  ‘This timely study looks beyond the headlines of terrorism and natural disaster that dominate Western perceptions of Pakistan. The contributors argue that contemporary security challenges and longer-term demographic pressures and energy shortages can be overcome if Pakistan possesses the political will to undergo wide-ranging institutional, educational and structural economic reform.’   Professor Ian Talbot, author, Pakistan: A Modern History

The Essential Reader,,PKR 400,"The struggle between the traditional and the contemporary, the reflection of socio-political changes, and the spectrum of emotions felt and expressed by individuals are some of the themes which come across in this selection of writings by Pakistani authors.  

This collection, especially compiled for O level and higher secondary students, introduces contemporary creative writing in English as well as translations from Urdu and Sindhi into English. The students will find a rich variety of styles, ranging from the irreverence evoked by folk humour to the subtleties of writings from the Pakistani diaspora. The selection falls into two separate sections dictated by the choice of language; yet interestingly, common themes of nostalgia, archetypal journeys, and severance from one&rsquo;s roots recur with a regularity that cannot be put down to mere coincidence.",9780195477115,,,,Paperback,,,images/9780195477115.jpg,https://oup.com.pk/best-sellers/the-essential-reader.html

Constitutional and Political History of Pakistan,"It has been seven decades since the independent state of Pakistan was carved out of British India, yet the country is still in pursuit of a suitable constitutional framework.

It provides a case-by-case account of constitution-making in Pakistan, with the inclusion of all pertinent documentation. Constitutional developments have been explained in the context of social and political events that shaped them. The book focuses on constitutional and political history, and constitutional development concurrently. It includes a liberal humanitarian reading of the travails of lawmakers and the role of generals, judges, politicians, and bureaucrats in the implementation of law.  

Students of law, political science, and history, as well as lawyers, judges, and professors will find this book of particular value. Being grounded in a socio-political context, this book is also of interest to the general reader.  

This third edition is updated to cover the constitutional and political developments till 2013.

Muslim Architecture in Pakistan,"This study, the first of its kind, is based on the author’s own architectural documentation and photography. The historical monuments studied in this book include baolies (step-wells), caravanserais, baradaries, kos minars, bridges, and hammams, which were meant for the welfare and comfort of the public. These were constructed during the Muslim rule in the areas now forming Pakistan. The book is illustrated with photographs and plans of some selected examples of such structures. Muslim rulers evinced great interest in raising splendid structures, many of which—particularly those reflecting the public welfare aspects of Muslim architecture— are yet to be properly explored and studied. Khurshid Hasan Shaikh has undertaken the task of documenting and studying such public welfare structures in Pakistan, as owing to the passage of time, vagaries of nature, and continued neglect, all such buildings have suffered. This book highlights the significance of the public welfare aspects of the vanishing architectural heritage of the Muslim era in Pakistan.

"Gender, Politics, and Performance in South Asia","Recipient&nbsp;of the Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan Memorial Award for 2015  

Tehrik-e-Niswan, founded in 1979 by Sheema Kermani, strives to empower women in Pakistan and improve their status through the use of drama and the performing arts. Tehrik held a Conference in Karachi in December 2010 aimed at rethinking issues of gender, performance, and politics in South Asia. The present volume is the outcome of this Conference and is based on the papers presented.  

In Pakistan today, a scholarly challenge exists to represent the multiple layers of Pakistan&rsquo;s history in order to bring the country out of the security studies/Islamic threat model that has become the paradigm within which Pakistan Studies are constantly placed.  

The book expresses various aspects of the social impact of the arts: How culture brings people together and leads to harmony and cohesion, counters violence and aggressive attitudes, and urges people to reflect and think. Through this exercise, the contributors of this book address an important gap in the study of South Asia in general and Pakistan in particular. The book demonstrates how, within the South Asian milieu, the cultural forms such as theatre, dance, music, film, or the fine arts have been used to advocate for gender and class equity, women&rsquo;s rights, and the rights of the marginalised. It explores how cultural forms and performances interrogate the constructions of identity, class, and religious affiliation.

Neither a Hawk Nor a Dove,"The book is the first comprehensive account by a Pakistani Foreign Minister who contributed in moving the peace process with India forward. This was hailed as the most promising dialogue between Pakistan and India since Independence. It provides a detailed analysis of the Kashmir issue and the complex Pakistan-US-Afghanistan-India quadrangular relationship. Kasuri believes that, whenever two statesmen are at the helm in India and Pakistan, for improvement of relations, they would have to revert to the framework formulated during his tenure as Foreign Minister.  

The author writes frankly about his Indian counterparts, Pranab Mukherjee, Natwar Singh, and Yashwant Sinha, and also Manmohan Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Rare insights are provided into the workings of the Pakistan Army, the contributions of the Foreign Office, and the author's warm but complex relationship with former President Pervez Musharraf. He also covers Pakistan's relations with China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran. On Bangladesh, his comments reflect nostalgia for old connections. The narrative is intricately balanced with the author providing anecdotes, both personal and political, alongside his observations on serious issues. On foreign policy matters, he deals objectively with those on the other side of the political divide.
Author Description  

Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri hails from an illustrious political family of Pakistan which played an important role in the subcontinent's Independence Movement. He was educated at the Universities of Punjab, Cambridge, and Oxford, and was called to the Bar from Gray's Inn, London.  

Kasuri took part in various political movements for democracy in Pakistan including the PNA (Pakistan National Alliance), MRD (Movement for the Restoration of Democracy), and the PDA (Pakistan Democratic Alliance). Like his father, uncle, and grandfather who were active in the Independence Movement and for which they underwent imprisonment, Khurshid Kasuri was also incarcerated for his political activities. He strongly believes in Jinnah's vision of a pluralistic, progressive, and inclusive Pakistan. He tendered his resignation from the National Assembly when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif wanted to push through the 15th Amendment which Kasuri regarded as reactionary and contrary to Jinnah's vision.  

Kasuri served as Pakistan's Foreign Minister from 2002-07. He assumed office in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 when Pakistan faced challenges with the US, India, and Afghanistan.  

Khurshid Kasuri is currently Chairman of the Regional Peace Institute, an Islamabad based think tank. He is Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) Senior Advisor on Political and International Affairs, Chairman of its Task Force on Kashmir, and a member of the party's Core Committee.

Sadequain and the Culture of Enlightenment,"Although the artist Sadequain was commonly regarded as a modernist, the author, who is well known as an art critic and connoisseur, suggests that his art was most modern when he was traditional, and strictly traditional when modern. This prolific and versatile artist was a khattat (calligrapher), book binder, master of drawing, painter, and poet. Thus, in himself, he recreated within one person the traditional guild of the Muslim artists and artisans of the Middle Ages, in which all of the above disciplines were in fact practised by different skilled persons. He thus revived the memory of this tradition in a modern visual vocabulary and syntax, which would appeal to the people and stir their memory of loss, at the same time reinvigorating their pride. In his poetry, too, Sadequain reverted to the traditional, painting the tragedy and ecstasy of love for a universal beloved, typical of the Urdu ghazal. Thus, he created cathartic works of great pleasure in each of the traditional disciplines of Muslim Art. Each of the essays in this book opens a window on Sadequain and his roshan khayali, or enlightened culture, the culture of the enlightened people of the northern subcontinent, in Dr Naqvi&rsquo;s interpretation of modern art.</span></p>

A History of the Judiciary in Pakistan,"One of the major organs of the state, the judiciary in Pakistan attained a particularly high profile in recent years owing to former President Musharraf’s attempt to remove the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the latter’s eventual restoration to office. The exercise of suo moto jurisdiction by the Supreme Court in the matter of enforcement of fundamental rights further enhanced interest in the judiciary, which became a focal point for popular aspirations.    This book undertakes a comprehensive study of judicial history in Pakistan since Independence. It includes detailed discussion of the acts, lives, and judgments of important Pakistani judges, with their continuing effects on the life of the nation.    This book will be of particular value to lawyers, judges, law professors, and to students of law, political science, and history, as well as the general reader.

Environmental Management Teaching Guide,"Environmental Management, Second Edition by John Pallister, is the revised and updated version of the text developed to cover the extensively revised Cambridge O Level and IGCSE&reg; Environmental Managementsyllabi 5014 and 0680, respectively, (for 2019 to 2021). Environmental Management is a subject highly relevant in the modern context, where the Earth&rsquo;s resources and life-sustaining systems are under threat of human impact.  

The scope of this book is international in its approach, and the aim is to enable students to understand and appreciate the interdependence of the Earth&rsquo;s natural systems and its resources, and to learn how to best manage them for the future.  

The book, following the sequence of the syllabi, has nine chapters that cover the topics listed below. These topics cover all aspects of the Earth&rsquo;s four spheres i.e. Lithosphere, Hydrosphere, Atmosphere, and Biosphere.  Rocks and minerals and their exploitation  Energy and the environment  Agriculture and the environment  Water and its management  Oceans and fisheries  Managing natural hazards  The atmosphere and human activities  Human population  Natural ecosystems and human activities  

In addition to these, Chapter 10, Techniques for investigation and examination, has been added especially to guide students through the study of the revised text, the tasks involved including case studies, understanding and presentation of data in various forms, and through hands-on activities. This will also help students in their preparation for examinations.  

The text is supported by maps, tables, graphs, and diagrams, and complemented by appropriately selected illustrations. Case studies give students a local, as well as global, perspective on ecological problems and their possible solutions.  

The Revision Guide matches the new syllabus and helps students&rsquo; learning with its skills-based approach.

After the fall of Troy, Odysseus sets sail for his island kingdom of Ithaca, but his voyage will take ten whole years. He has to face many dangers: the one-eyed giant Polyphemus; Circe’s enchanted island, and the sirens who lure sailors to their death.

Of Brick and Myth,"Pakistan’s shrine architecture, epitomized by the fourteenth-century tomb of Shaikh Rukn al Din Rukn-i Alam in Multan, is justly renowned for vivid tile work, imposing domes, and surpassing beauty. These buildings are also stylistically distinct from architecture in adjoining regions. This book traces the emergence of this extraordinary building tradition with reference to lesser known commemorative sites throughout the Indus Valley that predate more famous monuments. On the basis of extensive fieldwork, Edwards provides detailed descriptions of individual structures tracking brickworking styles and other significant craft practices. The catalogue of monuments is contextualized with a brief historical narrative and art historical commentary. What distinguishes this study is its tight focus on material evidence and local ethos presented against the grain of previous scholarship. Thus, whereas traditional analysis explains Pakistan’s tiled and turreted tombs from the top down, citing dynastic patronage and stylistic influences from elsewhere, this book argues from the ground up emphasizing politically atomized environments, vernacular building methods, pertinent oral traditions, and indigenous modes of spirituality. By this means, the unique character of this architectural tradition is underscored. Moreover, the conceptual framework formulated here is incisive yet flexible, intended to accommodate and advance the study of sites that still await discovery or sustained scholarly attention.

It includes those authors who either migrated to Pakistan or whose work is highly relevant to the themes engaging the writers of the new country in the years immediately before and after Partition. It contains a historical account of the novels, drama, belles lettres, and especially of poetry, written from the late 1940s until 1988, when this book was first written. It also contains a bibliography which is important since some of this material is now untraceable. Although there have been considerable later additions to the genres covered in this history, there is no other comparable historical account of Pakistani literature in English during these first forty years.    This book covers the course of post-colonial literature in Pakistan and the new course on Pakistani Literature in English that is being taught at universities in Pakistan.

Urban Pakistan,"There is a noticeable absence of compiled works on Pakistani Urbanism. Urban Pakistan not only seeks to fill this gap but also selectively attempts to update the state of the art and thus sets the platform for further works. It provides an essential resource for the fields of urban studies, sociology, anthropology, history, analysis, design, planning, management, and policy. This book epitomises the search for a valid position on Urbanism within the context of the enigmatic development of the cities of Pakistan, both big and small. It seeks to unravel the confusion emanating from unfulfilled planning ambitions for over six decades now. While it is an attempt to present urban environments as layered precipitates of civilisation, they are discussed as instrumentalities and support infrastructures of cultural practices. Urban Pakistan synthesises important but dispersed writings and their associated bibliographies, and identifies gaps that are patched by new works. It is a resource which will enable deeper investigations and will be of value to academics and researchers in these fields. The writings are arranged under four frames—1: Enterprise and Invention, 2: Space and Everyday, 3: Image and Culture, 4: Identity and Politics—in order to demonstrate their overall significance and also outline the issues surrounding each frame.

Issues in Pakistan's Economy Third Edition,"This book is about understanding Pakistan&rsquo;s structural transformation over six decades in a political economy framework. The author examines how and where such transformations have taken place in the economy, society, in class and gender relations, in manifestations of consumerism and culture, and in other ways. He assesses Pakistan's trajectory of economic and political development and focuses on an economic and social history of Pakistan, using a political economy framework to examine the nature of this structural transformation. The book follows the narrative of the evolution of Pakistan's social, economic and even political dispensation over many decades, highlighting key developments and events. As has happened so many times in Pakistan&rsquo;s history, events with unintended consequences have shaped developments. Yet, social and economic change has also been somewhat anticipated and predictable, giving rise to relatively more certain outcomes. The immense growth of urban populations, of a middle class, and of a buoyant informal sector, alongside the breakdown of state authority and state institutions, has been unfolding almost expectantly. The previous trend of the 'urbanization of everybody', seems to have morphed into an 'urbanization with informalization', with the co-movements of urbanization and informal relations of production and exchange perhaps dominating social and political interaction. What this means for subsequent developments remains uncertain.  

Issues in Pakistan&rsquo;s Economy: A Political Economy Perspective will interest serious scholars of Pakistan's economic history and its developments, as well as those who seek to understand how social and economic processes have an impact on numerous outcomes and forms of structural transformation, and how, in a political economy perspective, state and society evolve.

Institutional Barriers to Sustainable Urban Transport in Pakistan,"This book examines why urban transport in Pakistan is managed only by improving existing roads and building modern road networks, while totally neglecting non-motorized and public transport for the heavily populated and dense Pakistani cities.  The author shows that the export of knowledge from the developed to the developing world has resulted in a mismatch of transport policy with local needs for mobility and safety, as well as for ecological sustainability. He develops the concept of path dependence to explore how urban transport solutions in Pakistan have become locked-in over time as a result of past decisions on infrastructure investment, funding priorities, organizational structure, specific techniques, and mental models of international and local institutions.   The book identifies institutions, techniques, and discourse fields in path dependence as barriers to sustainable urban transport in Pakistan and suggests building the policy capacity of local institutions for institutional change in Pakistani cities.

"Pakistan: The Formative Phase, 1857-1948","This admirably written book analyzes, in a scholarly and impartial way, a mass of material relating to the creation of Pakistan. Taking 1857 as the starting point, Khalid bin Sayeed relates the diverse factors which periodically heightened or lowered tension between the Hindus and Muslims of the subcontinent.  Even fifty years after it was first published, Khalid bin Sayeed’s scholarly study of the formative phase of Pakistan remains the definitive work for the period.
Author Description  Khalid bin Sayeed was a Professor of Political Science at Queen’s University, Kingston, Canada as well as a visiting Professor at McGill University and Duke University. He gave lectures in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, having also taught in India and at the University of Dhaka.

A Concise History of Pakistan,"This is a comprehensive one-volume history of Pakistan, a country that lies at the centre of the world’s strategic concerns. The book covers contemporary crises in the perspective of the subcontinent’s ancient and medieval history to explain how Muslim nationalism emerged and how the community interacted with the other communities in the region.   Covering the centuries from Mehergarh to Musharraf, the author breaches the confines of political history to depict the intellectual, economic, diplomatic, and cultural history of Pakistan. Topics that have become the subject of controversy such as the 1971 Poland Resolution and the 1972 Simla Agreement are highlighted in boxes. The book is thematically addressed, but it provides underpinning by interspersing personality profiles of the individuals who shaped the course of events. This gallery includes Amir Khusro as the embodiment of a distinctive Indo-Muslim culture; Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru, whose lofty ideals nevertheless resulted in Partition; M.A. Jinnah, who is credited with almost single-handedly creating the state of Pakistan; and the volatile but tragic figure of Z.A. Bhutto.  In covering economic history, the author has also treated unorthodox subjects such as the rise and fall of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Kalabagh Dam controversy. In diplomatic history he presents little known material on the 1971 War and in intellectual history he examines the circumstances that caused piety to develop into terror. Replete with striking interpretations based on neglected but authentic sources, this book breaks fresh ground.

Enhancing Primary Science Teaching Through School-Based Mentors,"Recognized as one of the few books in Pakistan based entirely on a single research study in education, Nelofer Halai&rsquo;s Enhancing Primary Science Teaching through School-Based Mentors: A Study From Pakistan explores a multi-faceted approach towards professional development. It focuses primarily on teacher education, and understanding school-based mentoring in government primary school environments, particularly in the rural areas of Sindh.  

Aiming to develop a model in understanding key strategies, the author indicates existing gaps and exposes the readers to logistical components of workshops, while at the same time, places special emphasis on conceptualization of ideas for preparing and using appropriate materials to teach science to adult teachers. In addition to this, the book also provides teachers&rsquo; insights on how to develop themselves into mentors or teacher educators and thus enhance their impact in schools by not only teaching students, but also other teachers. Halai aims at aiding teachers away from conventional and towards new tutoring techniques by providing a broad context of study.

Jamal Mian,"This book relates the life of Jamal Mian Farangi Mahalli, a highly respected scion of Lucknow&rsquo;s scholarly culture and a major leader of the Pakistan Movement. Based on the archives left by Jamal Mian, in particular his personal diaries, it explores his life as a member of Farangi Mahall, South Asia&rsquo;s leading family of Islamic learning from Lucknow. The author covers the colourful life of a dynamic personality&ndash;from his education in the Dars-i Nizami and the spiritual traditions of his family to his rise to the Muslim League High Command, and his involvement in the campaign for Pakistan.  

Independence and Partition wrecked Jamal Mian&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s fortunes. An Indian citizen, he had to find work in East Pakistan to support his family. Eventually, the Government of India forced him to choose between Indian and Pakistani citizenship. During the 1950s and 1960s, while based in Dhaka, he was close to both Iskander Mirza and Ayub Khan. After losing almost everything in the Bangladesh crisis, he resettled in Karachi, and did different jobs. He was also involved in international Islamic organizations.  

Through the book, one is able to gain insight into his relationships with Jinnah, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Mirza Ahmed Ispahani; his close friendships with Hasrat Mohani, the Raja of Mahmudabad, Sadri Ispahani, and Mufti Amin al-Husseini; his consistent opposition to the Islamization of Pakistani politics; the extent to which his life was infused by poetry and spiritual devotion; and the length of time it took for the meaning of Partition in his life to be realized in full.

Intikhab: Ibn-e-Saeed,"This book is a selection from Ibn e Saeed&rsquo;s work covering the entire span of his creative output. With the recent posthumous publication of two undiscovered writings (Mehwar and Roshniyoun Ka Shehar), Ibn e Saeed is emerging as a writer to be reckoned with in the realm of Urdu literature. A well-known journalist, he also published more than 40 short stories through a long career but for somehow did not put together any collection of his work. A literary friend of Qurratulain Hyder, he shied away from any publicity. This has resulted in almost total neglect of this unusual writer. Because of his service with the British Indian Army, he was one of the first foreigners to travel to Hiroshima soon after the devastating impact of the World War and to witness the surrender of the Japanese forces in Singapore, experiences which provided material for his fiction. The editor of this selection, Asif Farrukhi, has researched Saeed&rsquo;s life and works to contribute a major essay on this remarkable but neglected writer.

Nigar Khana,"This is a selection of Shanul Haq Haqqee&rsquo;s literary essays. Haqqee had a fascination for words. Whatever he wrote, whether poetry, translations, criticism, or journalism, had a touch of his linguistic predilections. His chief concern was words and his experimentation in poetry was basically an effort to understand the usage and vocabulary of Urdu. Following in the footsteps of Ameer Khusro, Haqqee composed Pahelis, orriddles, and Kehmukarnis, a kind of comic riddle. He even composed Rekhti, a genre of Urdu poetry written in the jargon of women and expressing sentiments peculiar to them. This book can be used as a supplementary reader for students of Urdu literature as well as general readers.

Settling the Frontier,"This work explores the question of social transformation within the Peshawar valley from the sixteenth through the nineteenth century, an extended period when regional villagers and pastoralists experienced and interacted with the demands of evolving imperial and cultural ideas and institutions. For its Mughal rulers the valley was a political frontier to tame for stability and revenue extraction. Islamic scholars and proselytizers regarded the valley as a spiritual frontier of flawed tribal believers in need of guidance. Later, the British presented the area as one on the frontier of modernity, and so requiring new systems and technologies. Through this history, outside perceptions treated the region as a cultural frontier in need of the values and resources of neighbouring civilizations. Locally such influences were modified to produce a social history composed of complex degrees of change and apparent continuity. Early modern poetry and religious texts, colonial documents, and modern scholarship are drawn upon to understand sweeping, complex regional dynamics tied to interregional and global history. This second edition brings the book up-to-date with a fuller discussion of the literature that explains the region, both before and after 1900.

Cityscapes of Violence in Karachi,"Karachi is a city framed in the popular imagination by violence, be it criminality and gangsterism or political factionalism. That perception also dominates literary, cinematic, and scholarly representations and discussions of this great metropolis.  

By commenting in different ways on the trials and tribulations of Karachi and Pakistan, the contributors to this innovative book on the city build on past writings to say something new or different&mdash;to enable the reader to 
re-think how they understand the processes at work in this vast urban space.  

They scrutinise Karachi&rsquo;s diverse neighbourhoods to show how violence is manifested locally and citywide in protest drinking, social and religious movements, class and cosmopolitanism, gang wars, and how it affects the fractured lives of militants and journalists, among others. Oral history and memoir feature strongly, as do insights gleaned from anthropology and political science.  

The contributors include academics, ethnographers, journalists, writers, and activists: Nadeem F. Paracha, Laurent Gayer, Zia Ur Rehman, Nida Kirmani, Nichola Khan, Oskar Verkaaik, Arif Hasan, Razeshta Sethna, Asif Farrukhi, Kausar S. Khan, Farzana Shaikh, and Kamran Asdar Ali.  

&lsquo;This wonderful volume offers a vivid palimpsest of perspectives that brilliantly unpack how urban violence structures people&rsquo;s lives and relations in both contested and contradictory ways. It will undoubtedly become &lsquo;the&rsquo; reference point for understanding Karachi, as well as a model for exploring other violent cityscapes around the world.&rsquo; &mdash; Dennis Rodgers, Professor of International Development Studies, University of Amsterdam  

&lsquo;A mesmerising read, presenting original, provocative prose about a city that defines Pakistan in more ways than one. It offers rich perspectives on Karachi&rsquo;s politics, art and culture, and makes sense of its chaos, crime, and conflicts. Khan has done a phenomenal job of weaving together the themes in these brilliant essays.&rsquo; &mdash; Hassan Abbas, Chair of the Department of Regional and Analytical Studies, National Defense University, Washington, D.C, and author of Pakistan&rsquo;s Drift Into Extremism  

&lsquo;This unusual book does full justice to a dynamic, diverse, and troubled metropolis. Each chapter brims with insight, knowledge, and affection for Karachi, and sensitive portraits of its residents. Khan&rsquo;s volume strikingly depicts how violence, spectral and real, frames Karachi life, from ethnic fissures and poetry to masculine labour and alcohol.&rsquo; &mdash; Thomas Blom Hansen, Professor of Anthropology, Stanford University  

&lsquo;Very engaged and engaging. This volume brings into sharp focus the power of ethnography, oral history, memoir, lived experience, and academic authorship to map alternative cartographies of violence in Karachi. It explores the limits and potentialities of translating violence into words, raising fundamental questions of ethics, activism, and public engagement.&rsquo; &mdash; Nelida Fuccaro, SOAS, University of London, editor of Violence and the City in the Modern Middle East  

&lsquo;Karachi, currently numbering over 23m people, is projected to be the world&rsquo;s largest city by 2030. Khan has marshalled leading authorities to examine from different disciplinary perspectives why violence is integral to the city&rsquo;s workings. The outcome tells us much both about Karachi and about violence in human societies.&rsquo; &mdash; Francis Robinson, Professor of the History of South Asia, Royal Holloway University of London

Bonded Labour in Pakistan,"Bonded Labour in Pakistan is the first academic study of its kind, addressing common misconceptions of what bonded labour actually is, and, crucially, offering an agenda for future research and action on the issue. Comprising of a collection of essays, it provides political, legal, and gendered dimensions to the discussion of bonded labour across different agricultural and industrial sectors in the country. Fresh ethnographic studies have been included that offer a harrowing view of individuals and families trapped in a vicious cycle of bondage along with some seminal published essays on the topic. The book takes an incisive look at the exploitative practices prevalent in the mining, brick making, fishing, agriculture, begging, and domestic workers&rsquo; industries. It compares the practice of peshgi (advance payments) in industries which are comparatively less abusive, such as the football-stitching and bangle-making industries in Sialkot and Hyderabad, and analyses the differences that allow these two industries to escape the label of &lsquo;modern-day slavery&rsquo;. It dissects the elements that turn common practices of recruitment, wages, and &lsquo;benefits&rsquo; into tools of manipulation and control. Besides the social constructs of feudalism and poverty that help perpetuate the practice of bonded labour, this collection includes an essay from a legal scholar that deconstructs the weaknesses in the existing laws regarding bondage and the system whereby that law is meant to be implemented. It also looks explicitly at the fate of women, particularly in the brick making and agriculture sectors, and the violence that seems to accompany women under bondage.

Water in the Wilderness,"With poetic imagination and new science, this book takes you to the theme of our times, water.  

Written from a country that has revolved around water for five thousand years starting with the Indus Valley Civilization, it delves into little known places in Pakistan searching for freshwater and people&rsquo;s fortitude.  

In an age when water is the source of conflict, politics, disasters, Water in the Wilderness goes beyond current affairs into the corners of the Makran Coast, the greater Rajasthan Desert and the mighty Karakorams to show how it shapes landscapes, cultures, and wildlife.  

Essays from bordering Iran, India, Afghanistan, Tibet, and Central Asia remind us of the deep connectedness of culture and nature following unbroken routes like those of migratory birds.  

This book is about the beauty, continuity and fragility of a country much misunderstood and urgently seeking its core identity.  

A song of life in the face of death: essential reading&mdash; stunning photography &mdash; a crucial gem. Poignantly, insidiously addictive: meticulously researched, inspiringly written.  
B.K. Zahrah Nasir, author of The Gun Tree, Oxford University Press, Pakistan  

Water in the Wilderness is a work of great insight, artistic merit, and also of great hope [for] the country&rsquo;s rich, varied cultural and natural heritage.

Changing India,"One of the pioneering works by an Indian Muslim woman, this book is a collection of essays on a range of social reform topics including women’s education (especially of Muslim girls), dowry, beggary, the position of women in Islam, and the Indian woman’s status. It also touches on the Girl Guides Movement in which the author was an enthusiastic participant.    The author’s eloquent pleas for the clearing away of religious dogma and the reassertion of the true Islamic status of womanhood are based on sound knowledge born out of her own rich experience and study. She explains her purpose, ‘The disparity between the real Islamic theory about womanhood and the actual practice has been one of the causes that led to the degeneration of the Muslims.’ With Muslim women still struggling with this dichotomy, what she wrote seventy years ago is no less relevant today.

"Wrestlers, Pigeon Fanciers, and Kite Flyers","In today's Pakistan the dominant conservative mindset tends to marginalize leisure activities. However, traditional sports and pastimes, games and play, entertainment and amusement are an expression of happiness and joy and an integral part of popular culture. They represent a cultural system and preserve cultural values. The dimension of playfulness inherent in traditional sports and pastimes is clearly articulated in the culture of the Punjab in general and of Lahore in particular, especially in the Walled City. The popular pastimes selected for this study, namely wrestling, flying pigeons and kite fighting, are almost emblematic of the Walled City, an urban space where wrestlers, pigeon fanciers and kite flyers appear to be the veritable custodians of Lahori culture. This is the first book that details these traditional sports and pastimes, which, the authors argue, form an integral part of social life in Pakistan and create important bonds between various communities.

The Closed Valley,"In Pakistan, stubborn mountain tribes still lead a largely secluded life, preserving their archaic cultural traditions. Their distinctive features are Sunni Islam, strict gender segregation, a prevalent caste system, and frequent blood feuds already apparent in the layout of fortified villages with watchtowers. Jürgen Wasim Frembgen, renowned anthropologist, was one of the first to venture into the valley of Harban, a world hostile to outsiders, lying in the Gilgit-Baltistan region located in the Himalayas of North Pakistan, branching off from the east bank of the Indus River. The study was conducted over the course of several stays between 1989 and 1997. Enduring strains and dangers, Jürgen Wasim found a way to overcome the omnipresent mistrust. In this work of literary anthropology he narrates his experiences in sharing the daily life of a harsh, male-dominated society where he surprisingly discovers gentleness, poetry, and warm-hearted friendship.

Remotely Colonial,"Remotely Colonial is a monograph that examines tribalism and nationalism as historical processes in Kalat, which is today incorporated in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan. Kalat was 'remotely colonial' in two ways. It was located on the far reaches of the Indian Empire, and British interests were geostrategic rather than economic.  

The British designated Kalat a native state, but proceeded to marginalize the ruler in favour of sardars (chiefs) and tribal governance through jirga (tribal court) deliberations. This led to tensions between local officials dealing with events on the ground and the central government, which was determined that the facade of Kalat State be maintained. Colonial subject status-tribal, client or British Protected Subject-determined rights and obligations. The fragmentation of subjecthood produced a situation in which Kalat State became a polity with situationally defined subjects. Although Kalat State ceased to exist in 1955, its colonial structures persist today. Sardars and jirgas have become signifiers of entrenched tradition, a tribal 'other' of the national state. This is a convenient image for the Pakistani government, enabling blame for present conditions to be pinned on the tribal sector, deflecting attention away from the state's failure to provide basic services.

Nina Swidler holds a PhD in anthropology from Columbia University, New York. She joined the Fordham University faculty in 1968, where she is presently Associate Professor Emerita. Dr Swidler&rsquo;s work was supported by grants from The National Institute of Mental Health, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and Fordham University. She is the author of articles about tribal politics in colonial and post-colonial contexts.  

A graduate student when Nina first went to Balochistan in 1963, she observed a prominent sardar conducting court proceedings on his lawn, an experience which led to her dissertation on tribal organization and leadership. Concern about the limitations of the tribal frame led to an interest in the Kalat Khanate and ultimately to this monograph.

The North-West Frontier (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa),"The book covers a variety of topics about the Frontier (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and its people. It outlines the geography of the province. The three major theories about the origin of the Pukhtuns are recounted and the Pukhtun code of life, Pukhtu, is described. The author discusses the area’s occupation by the British in 1849 and examines the Durand Line Agreement (1893), along with its pros and cons. From the uprising against the British in the tribal belt in 1897, the book moves to the formation of the province in 1901 and covers the related constitutional developments. The role of the Khudai Khidmatgar Movement, the Muslim League in the province, and the 1947 referendum are discussed. The political career of Abdul Ghaffar Khan and the educational services of Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum are described. The administrative apparatus that prevails in the tribal areas is analysed. These various themes and issues are placed in their geo-political, strategic, and historical contexts to enable the reader to gain the kind of overview that might have required the reading of a number of separate books. Each topic discussed in the book has been fully researched and the commentary is knowledgeable and learned. The scholarship is exceptional, and the author is regarded as one of the top scholars of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The Unconquered People,"This book explores the history, ethnography and liberation journey of an aboriginal, forest-dwelling hunting tribe, which was reduced to servitude by the Aryan conquest of the Indian subcontinent. They were called Chandala in classical Brahmanic literature and are designated as Chuhra in the censuses of India (1868&ndash;1931). In contemporary Pakistan, they are known as Punjabi Christians. The book explores their primarily tribal rather than occupational nature, their homeland, and their spread through the Indian subcontinent. It traces how the construction of their religiously-endorsed inequality and degradation came about. Furthermore, it cautions against the suppression of the &lsquo;memory&rsquo; of oppression and argues that, by defining themselves as a lineage of belief and praxis, these resilient people can give meaning to their past and present, as well as purposefully construct a more humane future for themselves. Their very history is proof that culturally they are not easily contained, much less, dominated.  

The book also covers their rites of passage, eclectic structure, mental universe, and the evolution of their religious sensibilities&mdash;from animism to the development of the cult of Bala Shah-Balmik. The movement to Christianity of the Chuhras was the defining moment in the creation of a new social identity. It delves into how upward mobility of agricultural workers and tenants widened the social gap between the &lsquo;rural&rsquo; and the &lsquo;urban&rsquo; sweeper; and in the cities between the &lsquo;dry&rsquo; and the &lsquo;wet&rsquo; sweeper. It also provides an insight into the Punjabi Christian&rsquo;s system of beliefs in the world of hidden spirits, propitiation, and superstition, and traces their growing exclusion from Pakistan&rsquo;s mainstream in the face of accelerating &lsquo;Islamisation&rsquo; in the country.  

This work is a study of memory. In his attempt to narrate the story of these people John O&rsquo;Brien has not made any encyclopaedic pretence. Hence, it should be considered as an invitation to an ongoing dialogue rooted in further research.

The Pathans,"Morocco for Imperial France and India for Imperial Britain were the &lsquo;jewels in the Crown&rsquo;. Their finest officers were posted to administer the traditionally independent-minded tribesmen, the Berbers in the former case and the Pathans in the latter. Through sensitivity and intelligence, many of these colonial officers overcame their political and racial prejudices and came to know the tribesmen well. Some of them like Montagne for the Berbers, and Caroe, Howell, and King for the Pathans&mdash;have left behind material which contains authoritative ethnographic and political accounts. Their inherent bias in viewing the tribesman as a noble savage created a romantic picture of him. But the affection is genuine. Whether writing for the public or for more private, often confidential, readership, the respect and affection of these officers for the tribesmen emerges clearly. In a profound sense they identified with the tribes- men. Caroe is a good example. He was, as he never tired of repeating, a Yusufzai Pathan in spirit and heart. His love for the Pathans, their language, their code, and their lands was undiminished to the end. And, to the end, a lucid mind, a literary pen, and a wide circle of interested friends allowed him to contribute to Pathan studies. Caroe&rsquo;s The Pathans is at one and the same time a classic and contemporary book. It is&mdash;with its Epilogue&mdash;essential reading for anyone interested in recent development in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  

&ndash; Akbar S. Ahmed  

Louis Dupree, who knew and corresponded with Sir Olaf Caroe over a number of years, also writes:  

Although one can occasionally disagree with Sir Olaf, one cannot but admire him and, if one has met him, love him. The literary contributions of Sir Olaf will be around for generations to come. Also, he was a powerful figure in the British Indian Government and his role in the perpetuation of both the myths and the realities of the boundary legacies of the British in South Asia remains significant. History will continue to analyze these sensitive frontiers.

&lsquo;I have executed a memorial longer lasting than bronze&rsquo;. (Horace)
Author Description  

Sir Olaf Caroe&rsquo;s acquaintance with the Pathans&mdash;Pakhtuns or Pashtuns&mdash;is spread over a period of nearly sixty years. He first went to North-West Frontier in early 1916 as an officer in The Queen&rsquo;s Regiment and was stationed in Peshawar and Nowshera. After the First World War he joined the Indian Civil Service and, following three years in the Punjab, was posted to the Frontier in the Political Service where he held, in succession, charge of the Districts of Mardan, Hazara, Kohat, and Peshawar itself. He was later appointed Chief Secretary when the Frontier became a Governor&rsquo;s Province. In 1934 he was sent to Delhi in the Foreign Department in which he eventually served as the Viceroy&rsquo;s Foreign Secretary throughout the Second World War. The Government&rsquo;s dealing with the North-West Frontier, Baluchistan, and of course the independent peripheral state of Afghanistan, were in his hands over a period of some ten years. Later, in 1946&ndash;7, he crowned his career by becoming the last British Governor of the Frontier before independence. He expired on 23 November 1981.  

The Pathans is a labour of love and in its pages the Pathan and the grandeur of his scenic setting spring to urgent life. The Pathans themselves recognize this work as the locus classicus of their history.  

This impression includes an Epilogue written by the author (just prior to his death) in the light of recent events in Afghanistan.

Lahore,"The city of Lahore, one of the seats of the Mughal Empire, is regarded as the cultural centre of Pakistan and is famous for its many old monuments. However, the informed visitor or student has long felt the absence of a reliable volume on its architecture. Dr Rahmani’s book is diligently researched and deals with the history and architecture of old monuments in Lahore, especially of the Mughal period. The topic is rich in terms of the variety of building types and covers a period of several centuries. The study has been organized chronologically, highlighting locations, significance, history, architecture, and the current condition of each monument. It also discusses the architectural and aesthetic influences, both foreign and local, and contains a comprehensive statement of achievements of particular epochs. A comparative approach has been adopted to determine the architectural merit of specific monuments. At the end of the book, there is a chapter pertaining to analytical study of monuments in a historical perspective. The old theories regarding origin and nomenclature have been updated in the light of fresh research. The study, based on 33 years of personal observation by the author, also utilizes both published and unpublished sources, and official records.

Memoirs of the Badshahi Mosque,"Memoirs of the Badshahi Mosque is an unconventional attempt to bring together diverse aspects of the Badshahi Mosque in a single narrative&mdash;aspects that are historical, political, and artistic at the same time. Even though many general studies have been done over the years, few have taken a critical approach towards the history of this monument. There is a striking peculiarity about this mosque which highlights the need for further research&mdash;the paradoxical nature of its renown. Fame, at times, becomes a veil; the very idea that we know all too well about the Badshahi Mosque has prevented us from delving into many obscure facets of its fascinating history. This was a study that began as a humble enquiry into the nature of the interiors and embellishments of the mosque. With time, it expanded into a much broader work which attempts to bridge the many gaps that existed in the history of this Mughal monument. During the research process, the authors studied Sikh archives and transcribed the many letters written by British officers in charge of the Badshahi Mosque. They were also tempted to look at a sizeable collection of archaic images that lent a vision to literary imagination&mdash;making their claims much more substantial and the analysis more logical. Still, much remains to be unearthed from the archival collections in Lahore and Delhi. But while some questions are answered, even more are raised in the process. What is hoped in the end is that the reader will walk away with an understanding of the historical &lsquo;character&rsquo; of this mosque which is enriched by the fact that it experienced the reign of three different empires and witnessed the birth of a new nation. This book should benefit not only those interested in architectural history, but also those with an interest in political and social history of India.

Of Pearls and Pecks of Straw,"&lsquo;A ramble through my life&rsquo; is how the author describes what he has written in this book. A ramble indeed it is&mdash;wandering through childhood memories of a lost playmate, remorse over shooting a squirrel, the camaraderie among crows; and part travelogue. He touches briefly but not superficially on issues of the moment&mdash;religion, purdah, Westernization and Partition.  

Iqbal Akhund grew to adolescence in a family and social environment free from the communal tension that was, nevertheless, growing in intensity and virulence, culminating in Partition. He himself came to the idea in the course of scholarly arguments in his political science class, believing that Partition was not the best solution for the country but had become an unavoidable one. History is to blame, he thinks, or history as it is understood by the two sides. A history imagined and irreconcilable.  

Retired diplomat and man of the world Iqbal Akhund, having previously written about his diplomatic career, recalls in this volume personal reminiscences of his ninety plus years: young days under the Raj, the conversion of his grandparents, the why and wherefore of Partition, as well as thoughts on current issues.  

This book&mdash;nostalgic for a world long gone and with its generous spattering of fresh anecdotes&mdash;is a tour through time and place with a brilliant, witty travel guide.
Author Description  

Iqbal Akhund is a Pakistani diplomat of the pioneer generation who entered the Foreign Service on passing the first competitive examination held after Partition.

On return to Pakistan in 1987, he joined Benazir Bhutto&rsquo;s first government as adviser on National Security and Foreign Affairs.

Andaz-e-Bayan Aur,"This is a comprehensive, first full-length interview of the leading Urdu novelist, Qurratulain Hyder that unfailingly highlights lesser known biographical details and creative aspects. It is an intimate and free-wheeling extended dialogue between two writers, a kind of literary disquisition that is rare in Urdu, and no writer can vie with Jameel Akhtar on this count.  No other book explores this well-known author’s work in such detail. This is an important and insightful view of Qurratulain Hyder’s life and work.

Cover Point,"Jamsheed Marker&rsquo;s lifetime in the diplomatic service of Pakistan gave him a unique vantage point. In cricket terms, he was at cover point, &lsquo;near enough to the wicket to follow the action around the stumps...yet sufficiently distant for a general overview of the state of play&rsquo;. Unlike his previously published book Quiet Diplomacy: Memoirs of an Ambassadorof Pakistan(OUP, 2010), which is a rich history of his many ambassadorial assignments, Cover Pointmainly covers Marker&rsquo;s &lsquo;impressions&rsquo; of Pakistan&rsquo;s most powerful leaders. With the exception of the incorruptible Quaid-i-Azam&nbsp;Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his lieutenant Liaquat Ali Khan, all of Pakistan&rsquo;s leaders &lsquo;succumbed, in increasingly pernicious fashion, to the malign and pervasive influences of sycophancy and flattery&rsquo;. This work relates the first-hand impressions of the author which he garnered during his illustrious career, starting with Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah up until the rule of General Pervez Musharraf.
Author Description  

Distinguished veteran Pakistani diplomat Jamsheed Markerhails from a well-known Parsee family of Quetta and Karachi. He was born on 24 November 1922 in Hyderabad, India.

In April 1965 Jamsheed Marker was appointed as High Commissioner of Pakistan to Ghana. Over the next thirty years he served as Pakistan&rsquo;s Ambassador continually, in ten different capitals, with nine further concurrent accreditations, earning the distinction of being the world's longest serving ambassador, and ambassador to more countries than any other person. In 1986, when Marker was appointed Ambassador to the United States, he helped negotiate the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan. At the United Nations, he served as Chair of the UN Security Council, as Special Advisor to the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and as UN&rsquo;s Special Envoy to East Timor in 1999.

He wrote his autobiography with his descendants in mind, because he thought that children would be interested in learning about their forefathers. He relates details about his family, friends, and various notable personalities of Delhi.  He shares with the reader the experiences of his life and his long journalistic and literary career.
Author Description  Born in Delhi in 1888, Mulla Wahidi was a writer, publisher, journalist and businessman, all rolled into one. Although equipped with little formal schooling, he began contributing to established literary magazines when he was only eighteen. In July 1909, he launched the famous Nizam-ul-Mashaekh monthly from Delhi. After a long and distinguished career in literature and journalism,  he died in Karachi in 1976.

Eqbal Ahmad,"Eqbal Ahmad, committed democrat and progressive Muslim, saw the future without a crystal ball. He read and travelled widely, met great minds involved in international affairs, novelists, poets, and journalists. A former anti-Vietnam War activist in the USA he was indicted in 1971 with others for conspiracy to kidnap National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger. After a jury threw the case out, he became a major critic of US foreign policy. As a critical outsider, he argued that the Cold War did not define the post-1945 world. Rather, Africans, Asians, and Latin Americans caught in proxy wars for the great powers faced constant upheaval and subversion. The defining forces were revolution and counterinsurgency.  

Ahmad taught in Massachusetts and became a columnist, with a weekly readership of some four million people. His friends in the USA included Edward Said, Noam Chomsky, Richard Falk, and Howard Zinn. In Pakistan, where he returned in the latter part of his life, he became a cross-border peacemaker between India and Pakistan as well as an anti-nuclear activist.  

Stuart Schaar&rsquo;s book highlights the many ways that Ahmad&rsquo;s ideas and predictions carry weight and deserve our attention. His analysis of terrorism and insurgency still appears relevant and timely. His legacy as a peacemaker and his stress on non-violence and mass mobilization also serve as models for contemporary activists.  

&lsquo;Ahmad was an inspiring figure, in his work and his life. There could hardly be a better model to try to follow, as best we can.&rsquo;  

Noam Chomsky, &lsquo;Foreward&rsquo;, to The Selected Writings of Eqbal Ahmad  

&lsquo;Perhaps the shrewdest and most original anti-imperialist analyst of Asia and Africa&hellip;.&rsquo; &lsquo;He brought wisdom and integrity to the cause of oppressed peoples.&rsquo;  

Edward W. Said, [Obituary] The Guardian (London), 14 May 1999  

&lsquo;I think he was ahead of almost everyone in seeing brilliantly the commonalities between the various kinds of fundamentalism on the rise in the world then: Hindu, Muslim, Jewish (West Bank settlers), and the Christian/market fundamentalism of the American right. He saw any kind of fundamentalism as dangerous, and repeatedly, during the 1980s, talking about the US aid going to the Taliban, and kept saying, &ldquo;You Americans don't understand what you&rsquo;re doing there. This will come back to haunt you.&rdquo;&rsquo;  

Adam Hochschild, personal communication to Stuart Schaar  

&lsquo;Knowing him has been an education. He is&hellip;the finest, most astute and brilliant analyst of contemporary politics from a non-European and non-Western point of view that I have ever encountered. Deeply learned and humane, he is a man of great, genuine learning... he commands history, politics, society, culture and everyday life, and as a consequence his analyses are regularly enlivened by the insight and generosity that eludes most other people in his field&hellip;.He is also&hellip;a man of reason and dispassionate fairness, never more then when his own sympathies are engaged&hellip;no one has the command and learning that he has&hellip;. I cannot think of anyone more distinguished as man and as scholar than Dr Ahmad.  

Letter from Edward W. Said to The Search Committee, Middle East Studies,  

Hampshire College, 6 April 1983  

&lsquo;Eqbal&rsquo;s traumas&mdash;his father&rsquo;s murder, his forced exile&mdash;he built into extraordinary bridges he many times crossed&mdash;to the humiliation of the Palestinians, to the anguish of colonized Algerians, to the devastated residents of Beirut in the early 1980s after Israeli bombing, to struggling American blacks, to frightened immigrants, and to multicultural peoples&mdash;in distress or not in distress&mdash;everywhere. Eqbal lived a big life. He had a wide compass of empathy, and many deep friendships, among them, one with my husband Adam and me. We were honored to know and love him. He was a great man.&rsquo;

Cricket: A Bridge of Peace,"This book was written when the author was manager of the Pakistan cricket team during its tour of India in 1999 and the World Cup in South Africa in 2003. The author has focussed on the role of cricket as a bridge of peace within a tortured society, South Africa, and between hostile neighbours Pakistan and India. It also chronicles the matches on the two tours, drawing cricketing conclusions from Pakistan&rsquo;s success in India and its failure at the World Cup. As an experienced diplomat and cricket enthusiast, Shaharyar Khan is eminently qualified to analyse the role of cricket in politics and diplomacy, and its moulding influence in public attitudes.  

In December 2003, Shaharyar Khan was appointed Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. During March and April 2004 the momentous series between Pakistan and India took place, and in the epilogue the author chronicles the events of that series. His conclusion now is the same as then: that cricket does act as a bridge of peace.
Author Description  

Nawabzada Shaharyar Mohammed Khan, a direct descendant of the Bhopal ruling family, was born in 1934. He did his law and acquired his master&rsquo;s degree from Cambridge University before joining the Pakistan Foreign Service in 1957. He served as Pakistan&rsquo;s ambassador to Jordan, UK, and France. He reached the top position of his profession as Foreign Secretary, a post he held for four years, from 1990 to 1994, when he retired. He was also UN Secretary General&rsquo;s Special Representative to Rwanda.  

&nbsp;  

Shaharyar Khan made his school&rsquo;s first XIs at a young age. At Cambridge he scored a half-century in the freshman&rsquo;s final. He played regularly for Cambridge University Crusaders during a period when Cambridge had eight established county players in its first XI. After university, Shaharyar played first grade club cricket for MCC, Hornsey, and Wimbledon, a famous club that he captained while serving as a Pakistani diplomat in London. He was elected a playing member of the MCC in 1962. Because of his career in the Foreign Service Shaharyar opted out of playing first class cricket in Pakistan. But he managed to continue playing club cricket during his assignments to cricket-playing countries and when posted to headquarters in Islamabad where he was an active club player.  

&nbsp;  

Shaharyar M. Khan has written two books, The Begums of Bhopals: A Dynasty of Women Rulers in Raj India and The Shallow Graves of Rwanda. Cricket a Bridge of Peace is his third book. He has also edited his mother&rsquo;s (Princess Abida Sultaan) autobiography Memoirs of a Rebel Princess.

Power Failure,"The book is a political biography of the author—in which she has intertwined the impacts that key political events of the country have had on her personal life—and on the destiny of the nation. It is also an anecdotal account of missed opportunities.   The narrative begins with a chapter on the author’s privileged childhood, her entry into politics, and the hurdles and struggles that she faced along the way as a woman politician in the male-dominated society of rural Punjab. She provides details of the deterioration and erosion of the country’s institutions. A unique insight has been offered on the rise of extremism. Pakistan’s close embroilment in Afghanistan has been covered, beginning from the late seventies right up to the first decade of the twenty-first century.   The book goes on to discuss the high developmental potential of Pakistan, when it was carved out of India as a separate country at the time of Partition in 1947; the unremitting diminishing progressive curve since the country’s inception; and the consequent rise of militant and extremist groups emerging out of religiosity rather than religion onto its political landscape. The author attempts to provide insights into the reasons: poverty and inequity of our societal construct, conspiracies spawned by individuals and interests, both at the national as well as international levels, who merely sought to serve what were often their perceived short-term aims and objectives. As an individual and as a politician, the author often found herself caught up, quite unwittingly, in the vortex of this issue and ensuing events, with her life often under threat, and her career in politics interrupted, even prematurely curtailed. Light has also been shed on the regressive elements in Pakistan.   Reliant on personal notes and diaries and other source material, Syeda Abida Hussain in this book, has recorded events that have resonated with her, and in which she had some part to play. The text has been enhanced by corresponding photographs, both, from her personal and public life.
Author Description  

Syeda Abida Hussain is a politician, horse and cattle breeder, agriculturist, and diplomat. She belongs to Jhang, situated in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Abida Hussain has the distinction of being the first woman to chair the District Council of Jhang, and the first woman to be popularly elected as Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan.

The Pity of Partition,"Saadat Hasan Manto (1912–1955) was an established Urdu short story writer and a rising screenwriter in Bombay at the time of India’s partition in 1947, and he is perhaps best known for the short stories he wrote following his migration to Lahore in the newly formed Pakistan. Today Manto is an acknowledged master of twentieth-century Urdu literature, and his fiction serves as a lens through which the tragedy of Partition is brought sharply into focus. In The Pity of Partition, Manto’s life and work serve as a prism to capture the human dimension of sectarian conflict in the final decades and immediate aftermath of the British raj.  Ayesha Jalal draws on Manto’s stories, sketches, and essays, as well as a trove of his private letters, to present an intimate history of Partition and its devastating toll. Probing the creative tension between literature and history, she charts a new way of reconnecting the histories of individuals, families, and communities in the throes of cataclysmic change. Jalal brings to life the people, locales, and events that inspired Manto’s fiction, which is characterized by an eye for detail, a measure of wit and irreverence, and elements of suspense and surprise. In turn, she mines these writings for fresh insights into everyday cosmopolitanism in Bombay and Lahore, the experience and causes of Partition, the postcolonial transition, and the advent of the Cold War in South Asia.  The first in-depth look in English at this influential literary figure, The Pity of Partition demonstrates the revelatory power of art in times of great historical significance.

Adhoori Yaadein,"These memoirs are based on four notebooks of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh. Written while he was a state prisoner in 1967, the book records his views regarding political developments in East Bengal/East Pakistan. It contains considerable material about the turbulent political conditions in which the Awami League and the United Front were formed, routing the Muslim League in the elections to the East Bengal Assembly in 1954. The author has made observations concerning several prominent leaders of the time, including Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, A.K.

Author Description  

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (1920&ndash;1975), Bengali nationalist politician and the founder of Bangladesh, began his political career as an All-India Muslim League activist in Calcutta. He was one of the founding members of the East Pakistan Muslim Student&rsquo;s League in 1948 and the Awami Muslim League in 1949. A follower of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, he entered parliamentary politics in 1954 as a member of the East Bengal Legislative Assembly. Sheikh Mujib was a member of Pakistan&rsquo;s second Constituent Assembly from 1955 to 1958 and served as a minister in the East Pakistan government. He came to prominence when he became General Secretary of the East Pakistan Awami League in 1953, a post he held until he became Party President in 1966. In February 1966, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proposed his Six-Point Programme, calling for provincial autonomy and political and economic equity between the two wings of the country. In 1968, along with thirty-four others, he was implicated in the Agartala Conspiracy Case, making him Bengal&rsquo;s most popular leader. The case was withdrawn in February 1969. He led the Awami League to a dramatic victory in the Pakistan general elections of 1970, which proved to be a key event in the emergence of Bangladesh. After talks failed in March 1971, the army began a campaign of repression in East Pakistan, arresting Sheikh Mujib and charging him with treason. The Awami League leaders who managed to escape to India declared a government-in-exile in April, with Sheikh Mujib, at that time in prison in West Pakistan, as President. Following the independence of Bangladesh, he was released on 8 January 1972 and sent to Dhaka, where he became Prime Minister of Bangladesh.&nbsp;He was assassinated in Dhaka&nbsp;in August 1975 by a group of military personnel.&nbsp;

Memoirs of a Rebel Princess,"Princess Abida Sultaan was the only heir to a major Indian princely state to migrate to Pakistan. Her autobiography spans the glittering era of the princely states, the end of the British Raj, and the emergence of Pakistan. The book begins with her childhood in Bhopal where her grandmother, the fourth female ruler of Bhopal, instilled in Abida the values of Islam and of spotless integrity, and also encouraged her to be independent and to excel over her male cousins and acquaintances in the tradition of Bhopal’s Begums. As heir apparent, Princess Abida helped her father administer the state. The centre-piece of the book is her agonising decision to sacrifice her roots and heritage to migrate to Pakistan with her only son, Shaharyar Mohammed Khan.  In Pakistan, she became Ambassador to Brazil. She entered the political arena by supporting Miss Fatima Jinnah’s presidential campaign. Throughout her life, she remained a committed democrat and humanist, and continued her crusades against bigotry, and the violation of human and democratic rights.
Author Description  Princess Abida Sultaan (1913–2002), born in the princely state of Bhopal, was the eldest of three daughters of Nawab Hamidullah Khan. Becoming heir apparent at the age of 15, she was brought up under the iron discipline of her grandmother, Sultan Jahan Begum, and was expected to follow in the footsteps of the four famous Begums of Bhopal. A fearless and independent person, she was appointed Chief Secretary to the Nawab in 1930, and subsequently President of the Cabinet.  An all India women’s squash champion, and an expert hockey and cricket player, Princess Abida was an outstanding sportswoman. Her favourite sport was polo and she became one of the few women handicap players after playing in her father’s famous team.  Princess Abida was a regular writer in the Pakistan press defending democracy, upholding the rights of women, and criticizing bigotry with the aid of her deep understanding of the Holy Quran.

Kept in solitary confinement, Sehgal escaped on the hundredth day of captivity, becoming the first ever Pakistan Army officer to successfully escape from an Indian POW Camp.     Compiled from the original notes jotted down by the author during the period of his de-briefing on return to Pakistan, this fascinating book provides an insider’s account of conditions under Indian custody. It is a spellbinding and gripping tale of individual courage, of disparate friendships made in adverse circumstances, and of the will to survive.

With the Quaid-i-Azam during his Last Days,"This is a first-hand account of the last days of the founder of Pakistan, the Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah written by Lieutenant Colonel Ilahi Bakhsh, a doctor of medicine, who was attending to Mohammad Ali Jinnah during his last illness. The narrative includes the author’s conversations with M.A. Jinnah, together with an account of the author’s diagnosis and treatment. This monograph is extremely valuable as it sheds light on the last two months of Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s life while he struggled with his illness and finally lost. The author was one of the very few persons who were in personal contact with the Quaid-i-Azam at this time. This account is based on the author’s entries in his personal diary. The book also sheds light on some traits of the Quaid, his demeanour, likes and dislikes, preferences and aversions, thus providing a glimpse into the personality of this great man.
Author Description  

Lt. Col. Dr Ilahi Bakhsh, MD, MRCP was born in 1904 in Chak Mughlani, district Jullundur, East Punjab to a family of eye specialist Hakims. A direct ancestor had been the personal physician to the ruler of the Punjab, Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Ilahi Bakhsh left for England at age 16 and studied medicine at Guy&rsquo;s Hospital, the University of London, and Oxford. At age 43 he became the first Muslim to be appointed Principal of King Edward Medical College in Lahore at a time when the entire British and Hindu faculty had just left Pakistan. Dr Ilahi Bakhsh led the herculean task of not only rebuilding the college, but also leading the development of medical education throughout Pakistan. When he died in 1960, an eminent contemporary Col. Dr S.M.K. Mallick proclaimed Ilahi Bakhsh as the real father of King Edward Medical College and of modern medical education throughout Pakistan. His other work includes a monumental 2,335-page treatise Modern Medical Treatment published in 1956. Ilahi Bakhsh was a medical visionary and a revered physician who is remembered for his lifelong care of the neediest as well as for his treatment of the Quaid-i-Azam and Allama Iqbal.

Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan,"&lsquo;Mr Bolitho has written a most readable and vivid sketch, in his familiar style, of the character and career of the creator of Pakistan. He has collected anecdotes and assessments from a large number of Mr Jinnah&rsquo;s colleagues and acquaintances, and he has strung them together very skilfully upon an outline of the domestic events of Mr Jinnah&rsquo;s life and of the great political events in which he played so dominant a part.&rsquo;  

&mdash;Tablet, 5 February 1955  

&lsquo;In his Jinnah Hector Bolitho has written his best book for many years&mdash;a direct, unpretentious biography of the man whose single and unswerving determination primarily created Pakistan and who&hellip;accepted the sacrifices entailed without demur.&rsquo;  

&mdash;Daily Telegraph, 26 November 1954  

&lsquo;By the test of sheer achievement, Mohammed Ali Jinnah must be reckoned as one of the most dynamic and successful political leaders thrown up by the present century. It has fallen to Mr Bolitho to write the first full-scale biography of this remarkable man, and he has done it very successfully.&rsquo; &mdash;The Economist, 4 January 1955 &lsquo;He has taken the greatest care to check his facts, and to take the opinions at first hand of Jinnah&rsquo;s contemporaries. The result is a fascinating biography packed with incident and anecdote, which does not forget the magnitude and the growth of Jinnah&mdash;a biography that is eminently readable.&rsquo;  

&mdash;Nottingham Journal, 1 February 1956
Author Description  

Hector Bolitho was born in 1897, in Auckland, New Zealand. From 1915 he worked as a reporter for a New Zealand newspaper for seven years before leaving for England where he published his first novel.

Pakistan's Agenda for Economic Reforms,"Providing a non-technical understanding of poor economic growth and performance of the public sector in Pakistan relative to that of peer countries, Vaqar Ahmed’s Pakistan’s Agenda for Economic Reforms serves as an interesting introduction to policy makers, journalists, and civil society organizations interested in carrying out research and advocacy work as part of their social accountability efforts and attempts to improve economic governance in the country. Delving one step ahead from recent literature on Pakistan’s economy, the author focuses on why reform of institutions dealing with economic policy regulation and management is imperative, while simultaneously speculating issues underlying the past decade, and identifying key areas of improvement and pending structural reforms that Pakistan’s economy could pursue for inclusive growth and social justice. Exploring the fragmented structure of energy governance, public expenditure management, trade, transit, and the labor market, this book serves as an important resource for readers wishing to have an understanding of economic challenges and reform options.

The Class Structure of Pakistan,"This work on the class structure of Pakistan is based on the framework of historical materialism. It is an important work, since in recent times class analyses have been largely neglected in works on South Asia, particularly on Pakistan. This study therefore fills a gap in our knowledge. Sketching the history of the region that is now Pakistan, it analyzes the class structure from the time of the Mughal Empire, through the distortions of the colonial era and the transition to capitalism, to the class structure of contemporary Pakistan. It avoids over-schematic arguments, attempting to proceed from facts rather than from any ideal forms. The study develops three propositions.  

First, the author establishes that the mode of production of pre-colonial South Asia was qualitatively distinct from European feudalism. Marx&rsquo;s notion of the Asiatic mode of production is more consistent with the pre-colonial historical evidence.  

Second, the colonial path of capitalist development of South Asia resulted in a socio-economic formation that combined features of the Asiatic and capitalist modes of production, which this study terms Asiatic capitalism. Empirical analysis of agrarian relations in Pakistan reveals the relative absence of wage labour and the continuing existence of various forms of pre-capitalist economic relations within the overall framework of a capitalist economy.  

Third, the vast majority of the non-agricultural working population of Pakistan today is engaged in handicraft and manufacture. However, manufacturing and services are dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. Hence, while being significant in terms of output, the formal large-scale industrial sector, which was developed along the model of state-corporate capitalism, remains relatively small in terms of provision of employment.  

The author concludes that the class structure of Pakistan is characterized by Asiatic capitalism, with the non-agricultural sector of the economy dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. This has implications for the country&rsquo;s politics, society, and culture.

Lessons from Implementation of Educational Reforms in Pakistan,"A resourceful insight for stakeholders and reformers on the future of education in Pakistan, Lessons from Implementation of Educational Reforms in Pakistan: Implications for Policy and Practice offers challenging research-grounded accounts from a selection of distinct research studies, carried out by AKU-IED faculty. These studies originated from two major multi-year international and donor-funded education improvement projects in Pakistan&mdash;the Strengthening Teacher Education in Pakistan (STEP), and the Educational Development and Improvement Programme (EDIP).  

Providing a blend of qualitative and quantitative accounts of practices, attitudes, and challenges of integrating local and international experiences and ideas around educational reform and professional development at micro-levels, and these projects&rsquo; promising implications at macro-levels, the book provides a distinct understanding of the processes of educational reforms in Pakistan. It delves into issues involved in understanding the nexus of theory and practice in the context of large-scale education reforms. While providing a conceptual base for reflections, it raises such critical questions on how local and global successful practices and experiences can be merged into new quality and sustainable projects and frameworks for educational change in Pakistan and other developing countries.

Education Policies in Pakistan,"This book is an attempt to study the education policies in Pakistan in a critical and holistic manner. The book discusses in detail the rationale of education policy and the process of its planning.&nbsp; It offers sociopolitical context for education policies to understand their processes of planning and implementation. The book selects major themes in education policies, e.g., Vision and Goals, Universal Primary Education, Literacy, Female Education, Language Issues, Higher Education, Technical and Vocational Education, Special Education, Religious and Madrassah Education, Curricula and Textbook, and Teachers and Teacher Education tracking each theme through policies from 1947 till 2009, when the last education policy was offered.&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  

This is a most thorough and comprehensive account of educational policies as they have historically emerged in Pakistan. It places these policies within the social, religious and economic context of Pakistan, and does so both critically and constructively. In pointing out the difficulties encountered, it also draws lessons, and therefore points to future direction of policy in the light of the well-researched evidence. This book reflects a profound knowledge of the educational system, and must be a key reference for everyone engaged in educational policy in Pakistan.&nbsp; Also, given the global interest in educational systems and comparative education, the book should appear on the reading lists world-wide.

Educational Crisis and Reform,"More than a third of out-of-school children of the world live in South Asia. The promise of universal quality education for all children of this region has so far been elusive. The crises in education faced by different countries of the region differ in their nature as well as import. Notwithstanding the differences, there are also some common denominators, such as the burgeoning population and growth of private sector in mass education.  

Along with the growing list of problems that South Asian countries must resolve, the pressure for delivering better quality education for all in the region is escalating, in line with the imperatives of a global knowledge economy. But reforming education is not just a technical issue. In order for education reforms to gain momentum, the media, the general populace, and members of the policy-making community need to be more informed about the various dimensions of the educational challenges faced by South Asian societies.  

The book is a modest attempt to respond to this need. The contributions in this volume are research-based and strive at providing a deeper understanding of the various dimensions of the education crises as well as responses to them. Among the aims of this book are also to reach out to an audience outside of the academy. While it seeks to provide insights into country-specific initiatives, readers of this volume will also be able to help those concerned with and about education to think more clearly about the challenges of education reform in their own particular context.

The Tyranny of Language in Education,"Language is closely linked with a person&rsquo;s socialization. It is something that develops in a community. The culture, political thought, and sociological dimension of people living in a group have a direct bearing on the language they speak. That is why language is never regarded as something neutral, and the medium of instruction used in school has far-reaching implications. It can facilitate the social, cultural, and intellectual development or it can hurt the capacity to learn. Unfortunately, factors other than these obvious ones have determined the language to be used to teach a young child in Pakistan. The failure to look at language as a crucial component of education per se has resulted in our failure to spread literacy and learning in the country.  

Can we reform education in Pakistan using any language? No, says the author, who argues her case from a young child&rsquo;s perspective. Since the first edition of this book, a lot of research has been carried out on this subject. The findings have not changed, but they shed new light on the subject and should certainly create more awareness among educationists and policymakers, as well as parents. The author proposes the roles to be assigned to the mother tongue, the national language, and English, the international language of the day.

Education for Development in Northern Pakistan,"The development of education in Gilgit&ndash;Baltistan is an impressive success story. Starting from very low literacy levels only six decades ago, parts of this rural high-mountain region today are among the educational front runners of Pakistan. This book analyzes the rapid educational expansion of the region and shows how rural households derive benefits from these new educational opportunities. Gilgit&ndash;Baltistan in northern Pakistan is now considered to be a model region for successful educational expansion and rural development.  

Education is seen as one of the key factors for development and is given a high priority in development agendas. In this cutting edge academic study, the author shows in detail the trajectories of educational development in Gilgit&ndash;Baltistan, from the earliest schools to the establishment of the first university, and provides explanations for educational disparities along the lines of regional and intra-denominational variation, as well as socio-economic and gender-related inequalities. This original research work, with in-depth village case studies in three unique rural communities of Gilgit&ndash;Baltistan, provides robust empirical data, analyzed through a state-of-the-art multidisciplinary theoretical framework and fieldwork methodology. The study also draws attention to persisting gender disparities and the threat of a deepening educational and socio-economic divide.

Discovering Sindh’s Past,"This collection of thirteen articles from the Journal of the Sind Historical Society concentrates on precolonial and colonial Sindh. These articles reveal much about Sindh&rsquo;s past and historically showcase the region&rsquo;s broad socio-cultural spectrum. Scholarship frequently overlooks the subjects and people in this collection. In part, this oversight is due to so few libraries (both in Pakistan and around the world) having copies of the Journal of the Sind Historical Society. There are no reprints of these articles in any other book, nor has anyone reprinted them in their entirety since the 1930s and 1940s.  

The articles in this book not only deepen knowledge about Sindh but also the history of Pakistan and the diversity of its people. They represent, like most research printed in the Journal of the Sind Historical Society, &lsquo;forgotten&rsquo; chapters in both Sindhi and Pakistani history. These chapters celebrate Pakistan&rsquo;s socio-cultural diversity and point toward how the histories of region and nation should be intertwined.

The Pathan Unarmed,"In the interwar years there arose a Muslim movement in the North-West Frontier (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), the Khudai Khidmatgar (&lsquo;Servants of God&rsquo;), which drew its inspiration from Gandhian principles of non-violence. The movement was dedicated to Indian nationalism rather than communal separatism. Virtually erased from the national historiography of post-Partition Pakistan, the aging veterans of the movement are even today highly respected in the region.  

Although originally written in the pre-9/11 era and the resultant war with the Taliban, the second edition of the book is more relevant today than ever. This book is the first account of rank and file members of the Khudai Khidmatgar, analysing why they joined, what they did, and how they perceived the ethics and aims of the movement. It also attempts to scrutinize how the Pathans, stereotyped as violent and tradition-bound, were geared towards the ethics of non-violence and reforms in their traditional code of honour.  

&nbsp;  

&ldquo;Using a mixture of oral historiography and archival research, the author successfully reconstructs much of the organization and ethos of the movement and tells the tale of its rise and fall in the politics of the time&hellip;the topic is an extraordinarily interesting one, the writing, at its best, is fresh and lucid, and the historical and ethnographic evidence is rich and compelling.&rdquo;

KOHINOOR,"The Koh-i-Noor is the world&rsquo;s most famous diamond, but it has always had a fog of mystery around it. Now using previously untranslated Sanskrit, Persian, and Urdu sources, and the discoveries of modern gemmologists to reconstruct its original form, William Dalrymple and Anita Anand blow away the legends to reveal its true history &ndash; stranger and more violent than any fiction.  

Kohinoor is a tale of greed, conquest, murder, torture, colonialism, and appropriation. Revealing previously unknown moments in the diamond&rsquo;s history, the story sweeps from the century the Koh-i-Noor spent embedded in the Mughals&rsquo; fabulous Peacock Throne to the years it languished unrecognized on a mullah&rsquo;s desk, used as a paperweight, through to the torture chamber in an attempt to extract the truth about the gem&rsquo;s hiding place. It is now locked in the Tower of London, where it continues to arouse passions as India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Taliban all demand its return.

Separatism in East Pakistan,"Separatism in East Pakistan: A Study of Failed Leadership provides an academic perspective on the Bengali nationalist movement, the seeds of which were sown in the 1940s. Being an original work by the author, the book aims to record the growth of the Bengali nationalist movement and shortcomings of Pakistani leaders in accomodating it. This scholarly empirical appraisal is a vital addition to the available literature on post-Partition history of the events leading from 1947 up to the breaking up of Pakistan and the creation of Bangladesh in 1971.

The Impact of the Afghan-Soviet War on Pakistan,"Since December 1979, when Soviet troops first entered Afghanistan, the country has remained a focal point in regional and global politics. With a focus on the 1980s, The Impact of the Afghan-Soviet War on Pakistan delves into both Afghanistan&rsquo;s history and the involvement of superpowers in shaping its present situation.

Mr and Mrs Jinnah,"Mohammad Ali Jinnah was forty years old, a successful barrister and a rising star in the nationalist movement, when he fell in love with pretty, vivacious Ruttie Petit, the daughter of his good friend, the fabulously rich baronet, Sir Dinshaw Petit, a prominent Parsi mill owner. Ruttie was just sixteen and her outraged father forbade the match. But, when Ruttie turned eighteen, they married. Bombay society, its riches and sophistication notwithstanding, was scandalized. Everyone sided with the Petits and Ruttie and Jinnah were ostracized.   It was an unlikely union that few thought would last. But Jinnah, in his undemonstrative way, was unmistakably devoted to his beautiful, wayward child-bride—as proud of her fashionable dressing as he was of her intelligence, her wide reading, and her fierce commitment to the nationalist struggle. Ruttie, on her part, worshipped him and could tease and cajole the famously unbending Jinnah, whom so many people found intimidating and distant. But, as the tumultuous political events increasingly absorbed him, Ruttie felt isolated and alone, cut off from her family, friends and community. The unremitting effort of submitting her personality to Jinnah’s, his frequent coldness, his preoccupation with politics and the law, took its toll. Ruttie died at twenty-nine, leaving her daughter, Dina and her inconsolable husband, who never married again.

Sheela Reddy, well-known journalist and former books editor of Outlook magazine, uses never-before-seen personal letters of Ruttie and her close friends as well as accounts left by contemporaries and friends to portray this marriage that convulsed Indian society, with a sympathetic, discerning eye. A product of intensive and meticulous research in Delhi, Bombay and Karachi, and based on first-person accounts and sources, Reddy brings the solitary, misunderstood Jinnah and the lonely, wistful Ruttie to life. A must-read for all those interested in politics, history and the power of an unforgettable love story.

Risala Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind,"Syed Ahmad Khan was serving as Sadr Amin in Bijnor when the Revolt broke out in Delhi on May 10, 1857. The events of 1857, directly or indirectly, not only shook the very foundations of British rule, ultimately resulting in an independent India, but also shattered the unity between Muslims and Hindus, and in particular the mindset of Syed Ahmad Khan. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he remained loyal to the British Empire and was noted for saving several European lives. After the Revolt, he penned the book The Causes of the Indian Mutiny &ndash; a daring critique, at the time, of British policies that he blamed for causing the uprising. The events of the Revolt have been described in detail by Syed Ahmad Khan in his Tarikh-i-Sarkashi-i- (&ldquo;Zila&rdquo;) Bijnore or the History of 1857 Revolt and its causes (Asbab-e-Baghawat-e Hind or The Causes of the Indian Mutiny).

"The Punjab Bloodied, Partitioned and Cleansed","The Partition of India in 1947 resulted in the biggest forced migration in history&mdash;some 14 million people altogether&mdash;of which 10 million were from the Punjab. This book is a holistic study of the first major case of ethnic cleansing after the Second World War. Besides shedding new light on the events through secret British reports, it also contains poignant accounts by eyewitnesses, survivors, and even participators in the carnage on both sides of the border.  

Winner of the Best Book on Punjab at the 2016 Lahore Vaisakhi Mela, the book provides a balanced account of Partition and highlights how religious differences are no bar to peaceful coexistence unless highlighted by divisive forces. It contains interviews of persons who survived the Partition violence on both sides, and have been candid in their revelations. This book will be of immense interest to anyone even remotely curious about the happenings of the most traumatic event in recent Indo-Pak history.  

The second edition marks the 70th anniversary of the partition of Punjab. It includes more oral histories, each uniquely reflecting the tragedy of partition. Theoretically, the expulsion of unwanted minorities from East and West Punjab by complicit governments in the partitioned Punjab to achieve ethnic cleansing is brought out into sharper relief in the second edition of the book.

Afghan History through Afghan Eyes,"Recent international intervention in Afghanistan has reproduced familiar versions of the Afghan national story from repeatedly doomed invasions to perpetual fault lines of ethnic division. Yet almost no attention has been paid to the ways in which Afghans themselves have made sense of their history.  

Radically questioning received ideas about how to understand Afghanistan, Afghan History Through Afghan Eyes asks how Afghan intellectuals, ideologues, and ordinary people have understood their collective past. The book brings together the leading international specialists to focus on case studies of the Dari, Pashto, and Uzbek histories which Afghans have produced in abundance since the formation of the Afghan state in the mid-eighteenth century. As crucial sources on Afghans&rsquo; own conceptions of state, society, and culture, their writings help us understand the dominant and marginal, conflicting and changing ways in which Afghans have understood the emergence of their own society and its relationships with the wider world.  

Based on new research in Afghan languages, Afghan History Through Afghan Eyes opens up entirely fresh perspectives on Afghan political, social, and cultural life providing penetrating insights into the master narratives behind domestic and international conflict in Afghanistan.

The Frontier Tribal Belt,"This book deals with one of the most complicated frontier quandaries faced by the British Empire in India, as the British Raj attempted either to control or accommodate the Pakhtuns of the North West Frontier (now Pakhtunkhwa and adjacent Tribal Areas), because the British colonial interest clashed with the centuries-old tribal configuration. The Tribal Belt was one of the most ungovernable, perilous, and hazardous regions among the British Empire’s many frontiers spread across the globe. For centuries, the tribes defied all those who wanted to extricate and dislodge them from their strategic position straddling the natural gateways leading from Turkistan (Central Asia) into the Indian subcontinent. For the British, tribal structure and organization, and their socio-political and religious dynamics, were something quite new, challenging, and exigent. The tribes that populated the area were left outside the British administrative structures of ‘settled’ India, and instead ruled them with a peculiar form of tribal administrative structure which fulfilled their imperial interests. The book discusses in detail the political, administrative, and social intricacies of the Tribal belt under the British rule.

A Princely Affair,"West Pakistan, on 15 August 1947, was less than half its present size. Nearly a year of negotiations, arguments, threats, and even chance, brought nine princely states into the Pakistani fold. Thereafter followed a long and staggered process of integration.  

Using hitherto unused and inaccessible primary sources, this path-breaking book completes the story of the creation of Pakistan. In charting the accession and integration of the princely states, this book shows, for the first time in detail, the complicated and often botched processes of the early consolidation of Pakistan. The problems emanating from this early period, haphazard constitutional integration, weak local political forces, the insurgency in Balochistan since 1948, and a weak sense of national identity and citizenship remain with Pakistan today.  

&lsquo;While there is a considerable body of literature on the accession and integration of the princely states to the Indian Union, hardly anything comparable exists on the Pakistani side of the story. Rectifying this imbalance in South Asian historiography, Yaqoob Khan Bangash makes a welcome contribution to the literature on state formation in Pakistan with significant comparative insights on why it differed so markedly from the Indian experience. Based on hitherto unused archival sources, he tells the important but untold story of Pakistan's former princely states with clarity and rare insights. A solid piece of historical research, the book is must reading for anyone interested in how Pakistan negotiated the postcolonial transition and the ways in which this affected the nature of the state and its relations with the different constituent units, and especially the former princely states.&rsquo;

The Oxford Companion to Pakistani History,"Insofar as history is constantly in the process of being reconfigured in the light of new processes and challenges, any Companion to the history of Pakistan cannot but be an ongoing, if not obviously an open-ended enterprise. The historiography of Pakistan has been missing such a comprehensive survey of not only sixty-five years of the country&rsquo;s existence but also of the movement preceding its creation.  

Pakistan possesses a rich and varied history, considering that it was carved out of the Indian subcontinent, one of the world&rsquo;s oldest civilizations&mdash;hence the prevailing geographical, religious, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversities and complexities. The Oxford Companion to Pakistani History has attempted to provide the reader with information on as colourful a spectrum of subjects as possible.  

This is the first time that all facets of Pakistani history have been covered in one encyclopaedic volume. A wide range of topics have been discussed: from the pre-Partition colonial period to post-Partition movements (religious, political, cultural, etc.), peoples and places, culture, architecture, politics, military, economics, linguistics, archaeology, judiciary, art, theatre, education, foreign relations, government, media, philanthropy, civil society, and several others.  

The Companion differs from other encyclopaedias in the sense that all entries have been written in an analytical, unbiased style by well-known experts in the related field of the topic, paying the keenest attention to factual details. A system of cross-referencing is available through insertion of asterisks within the text linking the entry to another headword that may appear while reading a particular entry. Maps of Pakistan and the Indian subcontinent, along with a Subject Index, are provided at the end of the volume. All these steps have been taken to render the Companion as user-friendly as possible.

Learning to Live with the Bomb,"This work highlights and explores the elements that went into the formulation of Pakistan&rsquo;s nuclear policy. It covers the history of the evolution of Pakistan&rsquo;s nuclear weapons management system, including its nuclear doctrine and the measures in place to secure and safeguard them.  

&lsquo;The book&rsquo;s great significance lies in the fact that it tackles the little known subject of nuclear learning most comprehensively in all its dimensions. With great clarity and balance, the author clearly highlights the discernible aspects of Pakistan&rsquo;s learning experience and establishes beyond doubt that Pakistan has learnt from crises events and has evolved into a responsible nuclear weapons state with effective command, control, and custodial arrangements in place.&rsquo;

INDUS WATERS TREATY,"1st&nbsp;Runner-up of the Karachi Literature Festival (KLF)-German Peace Prize for 2018  

Negotiated under the World Bank auspices, the Indus Waters Treaty (signed in 1960) settled the water dispute by dividing the Indus Rivers, allocating three Eastern Rivers to India and three Western Rivers to Pakistan. The Treaty worked well for some time but has run into difficulties in recent years.&nbsp;  

The book deals with the genesis of the dispute, the World Bank&rsquo;s role in the settlement, the Wullar Barrage, Salal, Baglihar, and Kishenganga Dams disputes, the impact of climate change on the Treaty, India&rsquo;s current discontentment with the Treaty, and its treatment of Nepal and Bangladesh on the water issue.  

This is the first ever study which approaches the subject from political and legal perspectives. Based on declassified World Bank documents, at least four aspects of the book may be termed as unique to it. First, it demonstrates that it was the World Bank which made Pakistan surrender the Eastern Rivers to India with an ulterior motive to rope in the latter into the Western fold in the Cold War struggle. Second, it reveals that Pakistan lost the Baglihar case due to the curt attitude of the leader of the Pakistan delegation, provoking the Neutral Expert to give his pronouncement against it. Third, it studies for the first time the possible effect of climate change on the Indus Rivers and its political fallout on the two countries. Fourth and final, it investigates India's uncompromising attitude and explores ways and means of getting out of the water imbroglio.

How Pakistan got Divided,"The book is an eyewitness account of the events that led to a civil war in&nbsp;&nbsp; East Pakistan, which culminated in the creation of Bangladesh. It is written by Major General Rao Farman Ali Khan, a well-known army officer present in the Eastern Wing during the war of 1971. His experience of the Eastern Wing spanned almost five years; in the latter three years (1969&ndash;71), he held the key appointment of Advisor on Civil Affairs to the Governor of East Pakistan. By virtue of this role, and the length of his tenure in East Pakistan, he acquired deep insight and knowledge of the political and military events as they unfolded.  

In this candid account, Rao Farman Ali&nbsp; brings to light the political undercurrents and aspects of the military conflict generally not known. His personal interactions with both, the Bengali and West Pakistani politicians, as well as the military commanders, gave him a unique vantage point to analyse the events and decisions taken that led to the fateful day&mdash;16 December 1971&mdash;the division of Pakistan.
Author Description  

Born in Kalanaur, India, Rao Farman Ali Khan (1922&ndash;2004) was educated in Okara, Ambala, and Lahore. He was commissioned into the 1st Mountain Royal Artillery Regiment in 1942 and served the British Allied Forces at the Burma front and Japan. After opting for the Pakistan Army in 1947, he attended the Staff College at Camberley, UK (1952) and the Gunnery Course at Fort Leavenworth, USA (1956).  

&nbsp;After various important staff and command assignments, Rao Farman Ali was posted to East Pakistan, where he served in Dacca as Commander Artillery 14 Division (1967&ndash;69), and as Advisor on Civil-Political Affairs to successive governors (1969&ndash;71). He was promoted to Major General in 1970. Following the surrender at Dacca (1971), Rao Farman remained prisoner of war (POW) in India until 1974. After repatriation, he was appointed Director General Military Training (DGMT).  

&nbsp;Later, as MD Fauji Foundation (1975&ndash;85), Rao Farman turned the company into a commercial giant by strategically redirecting it towards the fertilizer and hydrocarbon sector, setting up Fauji Fertilizer Company (FFC). He retired from the army in 1976.  

He also served as Federal Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources (1981&ndash;83).

The Kashmir Dispute 1947-2012,"The Kashmir Dispute 1947–2012 traces the complex history of this long- standing issue, and the political discontent and dissent surrounding it— relating especially to the question of the accession of the state of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India.    The book opens with a critical and insightful introduction based on recently published material, which illuminates the multitudinous issues and resolutions relating to Kashmir in a holistic manner. It then delves into the intricacies of the Kashmir problem with a collection of the author’s articles published over the last five decades in various dailies, journals, and books, bringing to light many hitherto unknown or forgotten issues and facts relating to the troubled history of the state. The articles, divided thematically into three major headings, namely, The Indo–Pak Dispute, The US and Kashmir, and The Endgame. They provide a critical perspective on the issues that are raised.    The book concludes with a selection of both archival and contemporary documents, which highlight some important episodes in the history of the formation of the state of Jammu & Kashmir and provide a background to the current political reality.

The State of Islam,"The State of Islam tells the story of Pakistan through the lens of the Cold War and, more recently, the War on Terror. It, inter alia, sheds light on the domestic and international processes behind the rise of militant Islam. Unlike existing scholarship on nationalism, Islam and the state in Pakistan, which tends to privilege events in a narrowly defined 'political' realm, Saadia Toor highlights the significance of cultural politics in Pakistan from its origins to the contemporary period. The book analyzes key moments in the history of Pakistan through the cultural politics that defined them, the intention being to show the intimate connection between matters cultural and matters political, and specifically to point out how they have both been inflected by the Cold War and its aftermath. The incorporation of the cultural dimension improves understanding of the values and thought processes of the people themselves. Timely and unique, this book is a must for anyone who wants to understand the roots of modern Pakistan and the likely outcome of current power struggles in the country.

The Warrior State,"Seemingly from its birth, Pakistan has been struggling to build a proper democracy and a secure state. Today it ranks 133rd out of 148 countries in global competitiveness. Its economy as well as its political system both remain static and both rely heavily on international aid for their existence. Taliban forces occupy many key areas of the country and engage in random violence. In The Warrior State, noted International Relations and South Asia scholar T. V. Paul untangles this fascinating riddle. Paul argues that the 'geostrategic curse'—akin to the 'resource curse' that plagues oil-rich autocracies—is at the root of Pakistan's unique inability to progress. Since its founding in 1947, Pakistan has been at the centre of major geopolitical struggles: the US-Sovietrivalry, the conflict with India, and most recently the post 9/11 wars. No matter how ineffective the regime is, massive foreign aid keeps pouring in from major powers, their allies, and international financial institutions with a stake in the region. The reliability of such aid defuses any pressure on political elites to launch the far-reaching domestic reforms necessary to promote sustained growth, higher standards of living, and more stable democratic institutions. Paul shows that excessive war-making efforts have drained Pakistan's limited economic resources without making the country safer or more stable. In an age of transnational terrorism and nuclear proliferation, understanding Pakistan's development, particularly the negative effects of foreign aid and geopolitical centrality, is more important than ever. The Warrior State is painstakingly researched and has brilliantly argued these points.

Bangladesh,"This book covers in detail the political developments that led to the emergence of an independent Bangladesh. The post-independence challenges described here are a valuable source of information on different aspects of state building. Kamal Hossain gives a vivid eyewitness account of his own involvement in the different phases of the political struggles, from personal associations, as legal defence for freedom of the media and victims of repression in the sixties and, in particular, the Agartala Conspiracy case. His later association with the Awami League’s team at Ayub’s Round Table Conference and with Yahya Khan in 1971 provides valuable historical insights into the events leading to the war of independence.     After independence, as Minister of Law, Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee (1972) and later Minister of Foreign Affairs, and of Petroleum and Minerals (1973–1975), Kamal Hossain focuses on the challenges of state building and political transformation. He offers thoughtful analyses of how a country, ravaged by war and deprived of resources, gave itself a secular, democratic constitution, won the respect of the world, gained membership of the United Nations and actively pursued peace and stability in the region.       Bangladesh’s pursuit of democracy was short-lived as representative governance and secular democratic politics were stifled by military rule. This book offers critical insights into the processes of state formation in the initial years of Bangladesh’s independence.
Author Description  Kamal Hossain started his legal career after completing his BCL degree from Oxford University and the Bar in 1959. During military rule, he defended the freedom of the media, political freedoms and civil liberties in the courts, and was one of the counsels for Bangabandhu (‘Friend of Bengal’, title of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) in the Agartala Conspiracy case. He accompanied the Awami League team to advise and work on constitutional matters in the Round Table Conference called by Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan in 1969. Soon after that he joined the Awami League and participated in the negotiations held with General Yahya Khan and his generals in 1971. He was elected to the Parliament in 1970 and after independence, he was appointed as Minister of Law and Parliamentary Affairs (1972–73), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1973–75) and Minister of Petroleum and Minerals (1974–75). He was also the Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee (1972).      Kamal Hossain is a senior advocate in the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.

Afghanistan and Pakistan,"This book surveys the conflict in Afghanistan from Pakistan’s point of view and analyzes   the roots of that country’s ambiguous policy—supporting the United States on one hand and showing empathy for the Afghan Taliban on the other. The author, a former foreign secretary of Pakistan, considers a broad range of events and interweaves his own experiences and perspectives into the larger narrative of the Afghanistan-Pakistan relationship.     Beginning with the 1989 departure of Soviet troops—and especially since the NATO invasion—Riaz Mohammad Khan examines the development of Afghanistan and surveys the interests of external powers both there and in Pakistan. He discusses the rise of extremism and religious militancy in Pakistan and its links with ongoing conflicts in   Afghanistan. Ultimately, Khan argues, Pakistan reveals a deep confusion in its public discourse   on issues of modernity and the challenges the   country faces, an intellectual crisis that Pakistan must address to secure the country’s survival, progress, and constructive role in the region.
Author Description  Riaz Mohammad Khan served as Pakistan’s Foreign Secretary (2005–8) and the country’s ambassador to   China (2002–5), European Union and Belgium (1995–98), and Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (1992–95). He is author of Untying the Afghan Knot: Negotiating Soviet Withdrawal (1991), and was the Woodrow Wilson   Center’s Pakistan Scholar in 2009.    “  This book offers an insider’s extremely well-informed account of events in the   Afghanistan-Pakistan region and an insightful perspective on history that is   normally not available in academic books. Riaz Mohammad Khan has produced   a serious piece of work, but one that is also eminently readable.”   –Shuja Nawaz, Director of the Atlantic Council’s Asia Center         “The most compelling features of this book are the analyses of Pakistan’s   intellectual crisis and of the interests of various regional players in Afghanistan.”   –Ziad Haider, Harvard Kennedy School

Pakistan's Foreign Policy: A Reappraisal,"This book is a penetrating analysis of Pakistan's foreign policy from the time of Independence in 1947 until the beginning of the new millennium. The formulation of Pakistan's foreign policy has been discussed from a fresh perspective. The author has tried to pragmatically examine the structural failures of Pakistan's foreign policy-making process and calls for new thinking on various aspects of Pakistan’s foreign policy, with special emphasis on Pakistan-India relations vis-a-vis Kashmir, and suggests various policy options and indicates their possible consequences for Pakistan. The author makes a strong plea for realism and moderation, taking into account the best interests of Pakistan, particularly in view of the acquisition of nuclear weapons by both India and Pakistan. The book is based on the author's personal observations and analysis during thirty-nine years of diplomatic service as Pakistan's Ambassador and Special Envoy to various countries around the world. This new edition contains a chapter on the post 9/11 developments in Pakistan's foreign policy.

Kashmir: A Disputed Legacy 1846–1990,"The Kashmir dispute has dominated India-Pakistan relations ever since the Transfer of Power in 1947. Alastair Lamb examines the history of this dispute from its remote origins in the first half of the nineteenth century—when the State of Jammu and Kashmir was created by the British sale of Kashmir to the Raja of Jammu—until the spring of 1990, when India and Pakistan appeared to be on the verge of a fourth armed conflict over this contested inheritance from the British Raj.  A formidable body of myth has accumulated concerning the chain of events which, starting with the Partition of the Punjab by the Radcliffe Commission in August 1947, culminated in the overt Indian intervention in Jammu and Kashmir.  In this book, Lamb provides a detailed account of the history of the Northern Frontier (which included Hunza and north-eastern Ladakh) in the final years of the British Raj and he shows how this may well have set the scene for British policy towards Jammu and Kashmir in 1947.  The book also deals with Jammu and Kashmir since October 1947, and includes a detailed history of UN participation, Indo-Pakistani negotiations, Chinese involvement, the State’s internal politics, and the origins of the insurgency. It delves into the details of the armed bilateral conflict over Kashmir, the three successive wars, the standoff at the Siachen Glacier, and Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, all of which provide an essential background to the present situation in Kashmir.

Jamaat-e-Islami Women in Pakistan,"This book critically examines the feminization of the Jamaat-e-Islami, a major movement for Islamic renewal and reform in South Asia. Through an ethnographic and textual study of Jamaat women elected to local, provincial, and national bodies in Pakistan from 2002 to 2008, Jamal draws attention to the cultural-political forces that enabled these women to become influential within the party and in Pakistan&rsquo;s major urban centers of Karachi and Lahore.
Jamal situates Jamaat women within Islamic modernism without reifying them as either pious agents reacting to state- imposed modernization or gendered citizens who use Islam for class-based instrumental ends. Jamaat women are represented as subjects who move in many directions by acting against and through the discourses of Islamic tradition, cultural modernity, and modernization.  

&lsquo;By nature of its innovative and original analysis of women members of the Jamaat-e-Islami in Pakistan, the book represents a crucial contribution to the field of Pakistan, Islam, and women&rsquo;s studies.&rsquo;  

&mdash;Emma Varley,</b>Lahore University of Management Sciences  

&nbsp;&lsquo;Amina Jamal&rsquo;s learned and masterly study of Jamaat-e-Islami women in Pakistan is a brilliant intervention into a specifically South Asian gendered modernity. This is required reading for all those interested in the heterogeneity of Muslim women and in the emergence of a female vanguard that cannot be understood through a dichotomy between secular and religious.&rsquo;  

&mdash;Inderpal Grewal, 
</b></b>author of Home and Harem: Nation, Gender, Empire, 
and the Cultures of Travel  

&nbsp;&lsquo;Jamal&rsquo;s biggest contribution lies in her ability to challenge the popular constructions of women who occupy leadership positions in the Jamaat. . . . Rather than being rooted in the past, as is so often believed, these women . . . play a very active role in using modernity to meet their ends.&rsquo;

Ibn Taymiyya and his Times,"Taqī al-Dīn Ibn Taymiyya (1263&ndash;1328) is one of the most controversial thinkers in Islamic history. Today he is revered by what is called the Wahhabi movement and championed by Salafi groups who demand a return to the pristine golden age of the Prophet. His writings have been a source of inspiration for radical groups to justify acts of violence and armed struggle.  

In order to explain the widespread present-day influence and prominence of a rather obscure medieval figure, this volume offers a fresh perspective on his life, thought and legacy. The articles contained herein, written by some leading authorities in the field, study Ibn Taymiyya&rsquo;s highly original contributions to Islamic theology, law, Qur&rsquo;anic exegesis and political thought. Contrary to his current image as an anti-rationalist puritan, this collection shows Ibn Taymiyya to be one of the most intellectually rigorous, complex, and interesting personages in Islamic history.  

This is the first comprehensive academic treatment of Ibn Taymiyya to appear in a Western language in over half a century. It should be of major importance to scholars of Islamic intellectual history, as well as to students of modern Islamic movements and ideologies.

The Philosophical Works of al-Kindi,"This volume presents the philosophical writings of al-Kindī (Abū Yūsuf Ya qūb ibn&nbsp; Ishāq, c.800&ndash;873), known as the &lsquo;Philosopher of the Arabs&rsquo;. Acknowledged as the first philosopher of the Arabic tradition, al-Kindī helped usher the ideas of Greek thinkers and scientists into the vibrant context of the Islamic culture of his day. He was deeply involved in the translation and reception of such thinkers as Socrates, Aristotle, Plotinus, and Euclid. Drawing on this Hellenic heritage, he wrote on a wide range of philosophical and scientific topics including metaphysics, theology, psychology, cosmology, ethics, and medicine. In these works, al-Kindī set out pioneering ideas about the relation of philosophy to religion, the oneness and providence of God, the nature of the human soul, the structure of the cosmos, and the eternity of the world. This book makes the whole of al-Kindī&rsquo;s philosophical corpus&mdash;some two dozen works&mdash;available in English, most of them for the first time. Extensive explanatory material is provided, in the form of an overall introduction, introductions to each work, and extensive notes. The translations are based largely on Arabic original texts, but in a few cases, where the Arabic originals are lost, on medieval Latin versions. The volume will thus give a wide readership unprecedented access to al-Kind?&rsquo;s philosophical and scientific ideas.

Great Ancestors,"This book breaks the myth of Muslim women being passive, oppressed, and apolitical. It retrieves the mostly forgotten lives and voices of women from the eighth to the early twentieth centuries in Muslim countries and communities who asserted rights for themselves and for other women, promoting justice in the home and in the public sphere. These narratives from East and South Asia to the Middle East and West Africa, bring to life the rich history of women’s resistance and engagement for rights, effectively overturning the misconception that the roots of women’s activism lie exclusively in modern-day Europe and North America. Women acted in their individual capacity and undertook collective actions in the public sphere. Not all the women assembled in Great Ancestors were famous or powerful, but they all exercised their agency for empowerment, challenging power structures, and opening new avenues for women. The issues of identity, Muslim-ness and women’s rights from a contemporary perspective and the importance of reclaiming this history are discussed in an introductory essay.

Journey to God,"The Sufi tradition as the ‘other face’ and ‘soft core’ of Islam represents a particular creative and liberal facet characterized by tolerance, humanism, and the accommodation of differences. That is why inspirational Sufi religiosity is inclusivist in nature. This book, which understands Sufi Islam as being embedded in wider social and cultural contexts, surveys the whole of the Muslim world from Sub-Saharan Africa across the Middle East to Eastern Turkistan and South Asia, with particular emphasis on Pakistan and India as its demographic centre. What distinguishes this study most clearly from the considerable number of introductions to Sufism currently available is that it offers an account of Sufi Islam from the perspective of the ethnographer as much as that of the historian of religion. Focusing on its concrete, practiced, and lived forms, it shows how popular Sufism developed into the almost ubiquitous mass movement, present at all levels of Muslim society as a dynamic force until modern times. This book is a revised translation of the original German edition.

The Origins and Early Development of Shi‘a Islam,"Backed with thorough and original research, this book is a study of Shi&lsquo;a Islam based mainly on the oldest historical sources, rather than on heresiographical works, thus filling a serious gap in the field of academic study. Here, the author has reconstructed and presented the development of an Islamic ideal in the form of Shi&lsquo;ism: that of a particular vision of religious leadership which derives its authority directly from the person of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and which, therefore, enjoys divine sanction in deciding all cases of conscience. Presented here is a rare confluence of traditional and critical scholarship, leading to the emergence of a most authoritative and comprehensive account of a crucial development in the formative period of Islamic history. This is both a theological and sociological study. The chapters on the abdicationof Imam Hasan and the social structure of the city of Kufa, present new material and interpretation.  

In a nutshell, his talent encompass[es] a complete grasp of the subject, a flawless writing style and a method of presentation meeting western standards of dispassionate inquiry&hellip;should be considered the best book on the subject&hellip;

&hellip;[This] is without doubt a very precious and welcome addition to the literature of Sh&lsquo;ia Islam&hellip;The theme of this book is immense. The secular historian will find here a reservoir of accurate facts which may help to correct the inaccuracies and distortions which mar even learned works of intensive research.

The fact that the study has drawn heavily on historical sources of both Shi&lsquo;a and Sunni persuasions, as opposed to merely heresiographical writings, gives credence to the work and brings to light some findings hitherto obscure to scholars&hellip;The book is not merely a history of Shi&lsquo;a Islam, but also a source of researched and analytical information on a variety of historical topics&hellip;

From Hindi to Urdu,"This book is the first of its kind on the socio-political history of Urdu. It analyses the historiography of the language—narratives about its names, linguistic ancestry, place of birth—and relates it to the politics of identity-construction among the Hindus and Muslims of India during the last two centuries. More importantly, a historical account of the use of Urdu in social domains such as employment, education, printing and publishing, radio, films and television etc. has been provided for the first time. These accounts are related to the expression of Hindu and Muslim identity-politics during the last two centuries.    Evolution of Urdu from the language of the laity, both Hindus and Muslims, of the Indian subcontinent during the period between 15th–18th centuries to its standardization into two languages: Persianized Urdu and Sanskritized Hindi are highlighted here. The writer looks at narratives of the names, theories of genealogy and places of origin of the language in relation to the political imperatives of identity-politics of Hindus and Muslims during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In a nutshell, historiography is analyzed with reference to its political and ideological dimensions—and a fresh analysis regarding the linguistic history of Urdu is provided.

"Language, Gender, and Power","The book focuses on the role of language as a powerful tool in representing and structuring the world. It explores how language can help construct stereotypes, identities, and human relationships. By constructing stereotypes language also manifests and perpetuates gender differences. The author examines how gender is in fact made up on a continuous basis in different linguistic and artistic expressions, e.g., sayings and proverbs, jokes, songs, films, TV plays, newspapers, theatre, and slogans behind vehicles,  and reveals how these apparently playful activities strengthen gender stereotypes unnoticed.  The book highlights the politics of representation and hegemony with regard to women with special reference to language.  The readers are encouraged to realize that on the one hand language is a tool of control and hegemony while on the other hand it can be used to mount resistance against hegemony by reversing the discourse.    In this insightful, original and comprehensive book, Shahid Siddiqui draws on the full range of social sciences disciplines to analyse the complex intersections of  language, gender and power in South Asian contexts. This represents an enormous and long-overdue contribution to the international literature on this topic. As readers, we gain a much deeper understanding than was previously the case of the ways in which language provides a lens to bring into focus the influence of societal power relations on the performance of gender.  – Jim Cummins  Professor, OISE/University of Toronto, Canada    Shahid Siddiqui's book gives a lucid account of interrelationships between language, gender and power with a focus on South Asia. The book is of particular value because treatments of language and gender in this region have hitherto tended to lack a critical focus on questions of power.  – Norman Fairclough  Emeritus Professor, Lancaster University, U.K.    This book is based on Dr. Shahid Siddiqui’s scholarly work spanning about ten years of study and field work. It is on a subject which has been crying out for scholarly attention for a long time —the relationship between language, gender and power. The author explores this nexus through conventional and unconventional sources including fairy tales, songs and nursery rhymes. This is the first time a Pakistani scholar has applied such prodigious learning to the Pakistani situation with such attention to accessibility, originality and humour.   – Tariq Rahman  HEC Distinguished National Professor,  Emeritus Professor, Quaid-i-Azam University, Pakistan

Uss Ko Ikk Shakhs Samajhna Tou Munasib Hi Nahin,"Meeraji (1912-1949) is an acclaimed modernist Urdu poet, critic, and translator. He not only laid the foundations of modernist poetry in Urdu by writing poems, making a break from his predecessors with his distinctively innovative and experimental form and content, but took upon himself to elaborate fervidly the poetics of modernist Urdu verse by analysing and interpreting poems. He pioneered the methods, ways and conventions of how to read a modern poem. Adopting a cosmopolitan, transnational view in translation, he proffered an alternate to the colonial narrative of translation, which mostly centred on English language texts. His poetic style also mirrors the transnational ethos.&nbsp;  

Meeraji&rsquo;s poetry, criticism and translations have not only been applauded by critics but are now taught in Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s courses of Urdu literature in Pakistan and India.  

The author of this study seeks to locate the position occupied by Meeraji&rsquo;s imaginative and intellectual works in both colonial and postcolonial settings.

Qila-e-Faramoshi,"This is a historical novel about the life and times of Mazdak, a man who lived in the 5th century AD, and has the reputation of having been the first socialist revolutionary in history.  

The novel is a fascinating account of the interacting forces at play in those times. All the action takes place in the Sassanid&nbsp;Empire when its capital was Ctesiphon on the banks of river Tigris. Contingent to it was its arch rival,&nbsp;the equally vast and powerful Byzantine Empire&nbsp;.Between the two Empires lay the Arab lands, largely inhabited by the desert &ndash;dwelling Bedouin tribes. Close to the borders of the Sassanid Empire and the Indian subcontinent, were the Khanates of the White Huns. All these entities played a role in shaping the story of Mazdak, the continuation&nbsp;of his revolutionary movement for seven long years, and ultimately his execution and the crushing of the socialist movement throughout the Sassanid Empire. At the same time the story reveals an interesting insight in the growth of religions and religious ideas during this important century.  

Relating it to the present-day world, the author, Fahmida Riaz, gives the story a relevance to today&rsquo;s turbulent times and the eternal human quest for social justice .It is a novel by a well-known author that would certainly catch the imagination of the reader.

Mehroom's first major publication was Ganj-e-Ma'ani which contained a rich variety of 175 nazams as well as many rubais, qasidas, sehras, andnohas.

"Urdu Poetry, 1935–1970","This book attempts to determine the nature and meaning of the term &lsquo;progressivism&rsquo; and&nbsp; assess its significance in the larger context of Urdu literature and, ultimately, South Asian literature. It investigates the emergence of the Progressive Movement in the subcontinent along with the indigenous and foreign influences: literary, historical, intellectual, and philosophical which set the stage for the Progressive Movement. Contrary to the belief held by some critics that the progressive movement was mostly if not
entirely, derived from English and Russian sources and influences, this study indicates that strong indigenous elements contributed equally, if not more, to the movement.

Kicking up Dust,"This book is a biography of the author and very skilfully presents a picture of her childhood, juxtaposing childish playfulness with the realities of the urban middle class she lived in. The prose is engrossing because it presents a child&rsquo;s candid and forthright perspective of the society she is part of. The curiosity of a rebellious child forced to survive in the adult world provides insight for the readers into the mind of a child forced to grow up before her time. A number of the author&rsquo;s poems, also translated by Samina Rahman, are included in this volume.</span></p>

Pakistani Media Law,"In 2002, private broadcasters started their own television transmissions after the creation of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority. However, despite the burgeoning of private television channels, there is a lack of research on the enforcement of laws and regulatory supervision of the electronic media in Pakistan.  

This study seeks to identify the challenges that viewers and private electronic media sectors are faced with and need to tackle for the better enforcement of media laws. The book also identifies and analyses the action required to improve upon the prevailing situation in the private media sector.

Saints and Singers,"This is a personal travelogue through the music and the culture of the Indus Valley as presented by the German writer and musician, Peter Pannke and photographer, Horst A. Friedrichs in 1997.   Very little was known in the West about Sufi music when Peter Pannke first travelled to Pakistan in 1969. What he discovered was not only the music but also the words and images, the colours and customs which make up the extraordinarily rich cultural tapestry of the Indus Valley. The author’s second visit to the country was in 1997, in preparation for a festival of Sufi music, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Pakistan in Germany. Travelling up and down the Indus, he found the music to be even richer and more varied than he had remembered. He met the musicians himself, recorded their songs, and listened to their stories. Since then, not only has the appearance of some of the Sufi shrines changed, but also many of the musicians portrayed in this book have passed away.   This book guides the reader to the heart of the Sufi traditions through a combination of text, photographs and the music itself, and the two Music CDs that accompany this book.
Author Description  Peter Pannke studied Sinology, Indology and Comparative Religions in Hamburg, Marburg, Benares and Munich. After many years of travel in the Near East, Africa, Pakistan and India, he settled in Berlin in 1990 as an independent writer and composer. For twenty years he directed a world music show at radio SFB/RBB. As musician and producer he has more than eighty CDs and LPs to his credit. Having studied the ancient tradition of Dhrupad he went on to create a personal style of singing and founded the band ‘Troubadours United’, a colourful and proficient troupe of Turkish, Syrian and Indian musicians. A profound connoisseur of oriental music, Peter Pannke has played an important role in the cultural dialogue between Europe and the East.

Secular and Nationalist Jinnah,"Mohammad Ali Jinnah is the most misrepresented figure in the political&nbsp;history of the subcontinent. In Pakistan he is considered the&nbsp;saviour of the Muslims, protector of Islam and Islamic culture.&nbsp;In India&nbsp;he is dubbed as an evil genius, a die-hard communalist, opponent of the freedom struggle, ally of the British imperialists and the one man responsible for the partition of the country. The real facts about Jinnah are suppressed&nbsp;by both Indian and Pakistani historians.  

The truth is that Jinnah was an uncompromising&nbsp;enemy of foreign rule throughout his political career. He was a&nbsp;patriot, a&nbsp;secular nationalist, and an advocate of Hindu-Muslim unity. He&nbsp;fought vigorously for Indian interests in the Imperial Legislative Assembly, refused any title from the British, and struggled for&nbsp;united India for forty years of his life. He resisted for long the proposal of partition and sought fair play and&nbsp;safeguards for the Muslim minority in united India; and when Pakistan was won he advocated&nbsp;the same for&nbsp;the Hindu minority.  

Secular and Nationalist Jinnah challenges many of the myths that have grown round Jinnah&rsquo;s&nbsp;role in the freedom movement and&nbsp;reveals his true character&nbsp;to readers around the world.

A Cry for Justice,"Balochistan is clich&eacute;d as the largest province of Pakistan with the smallest population and with vast natural resources. This is indeed true. It is also true that with just 1.5 million families, Balochistan&mdash;at one job per family&mdash;needs just 1.5 million jobs. Yet the province is abjectly under-developed, with virtually absent physical infrastructure and abysmally low social development indicators. Unemployment and poverty, even hunger, is rampant. Local discontent and anger over the state of affairs has repeatedly boiled over into insurgencies, with one under way currently.  

A Cry for Justice empirically documents five different aspects of under-development and deprivation in Balochistan: gas pricing, federal development expenditure, federal social protection, federal civil service, and structure of electoral representation. It is the first attempt to detail the facts of systematic economic exploitation, discrimination, and neglect that Balochistan has shouldered and continues to face&mdash;minus the fiction of imagined wrongs.

"Islam, Ethnicity, and Power Politics","Islam, Ethnicity, and Power Politics explores how the central state apparatus, social forces, ethnic groups, political elites, and religious factions have attempted to influence the construction of identity in Pakistan, and why it has become such a contested issue. The book analyzes the issue of identity in relation to power dynamics and competing ideologies, and argues that the choice and expression of a specific identity by contending political actors serves to claim, legitimize, and challenge power.  

The postcolonial inheritance of ethnic diversity and cultural pluralism that is embedded deep in regional histories as well as in the multiple layers of narrow tribal, caste, and parochial affiliations have not lent easily to the coveted idea of a single national culture or a particular sense of national identity. Against a conventional view of identity, the book makes the counter-argument of multiculturalism and a layered idea of identities that is contextualized.  

The defining idea of the book is that the cultural diversity of Pakistan&mdash;a rich mosaic&mdash;is not the problem that it is generally conceived to be. Conversely, it argues that diversity and pluralism in Pakistan or elsewhere can be managed and made to evolve into national solidarity and political cohesion through democratic, federal, and republican politics. However, such a diverse society requires a pluralistic political framework of equality, accommodation, inclusiveness, recognition, and rights.

Governance in Pakistan,"This book suggests that Pakistan has been stuck in a transition characterized by the simultaneous existence of particularistic- emotional societal features alongside rational-democratic values. The country’s governing elite could have led the society to cross the transition threshold through appropriate socio-political reforms, but being itself the product of existing social structures, it possesses both an authoritarian inclination as well as a belief in the legitimacy of a rational-democratic order. It is thus constrained by the paradox of practicing authoritarianism while seeking legitimacy in democratic terms.  Thus, the governing elite neither adopt consistent coercion nor complete accommodation. The task of adjustment between irreconcilable features compels adoption of a framework of decision-making which accounts only for the immediate changing context. This ad hoc governance keeps the state oscillating between the poles of being an effective, resilient state or a failed state. This book is must read for those wishing to understand the governance perspective in Pakistan underlined by this paradigm.

A History of Pakistan,"Although Pakistan may be a new state in an historical context, it possesses an ancient legacy and culture. This volume examines the history of Pakistan from its archaeological heritage and origins in the Islamic civilization in South Asia to its political, economic, and social characteristics since 1947. The dynamics of its volatile history have been conditioned by its chequered constitutional development. It has produced vividand forceful leaders, both civilian and military, from the Bhuttos–Zulfikar Ali and his daughter Benazir–to the string of military rulers who have governed thecountry, namely, Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Zia ul-Haq, and the last military dictator, Pervez Musharraf. Religious and class differences and regional forces tear at the fabric of the nation and hinder the development of a stable democratic regime. In spite of these persistent retrograde forces, there is a remarkable commitment among the progressives and the educated of the country to move it forward. Pakistan possesses a remarkable history through its interplay of regional and economics forces, through wars and civil wars, through being a 'Front-Line State', and through nuclear confrontations in the form of nuclear tests performed by Pakistan as well as its neighbour India. This volume is a rich and authoritative guide to those turbulent decades as well as to the history of the Indian subcontinent.

Conflict Management &amp; Vision for a Secular Pakistan,"This book aims to examine the vision for the state of Pakistan as perceived by the founders of the country. It argues that conflicts, particularly those at sectarian and communal levels, can be effectively managed by following a secular approach. This would require the adoption of a secular ‘toolkit’ primarily composed of tolerance, neutrality in religious matters, religious freedom, good governance, and the rule of law. A secular approach does not imply anti-religious thought or practice, rather a neutral and unbiased way of understanding that can be perceived as just and fair.    The adoption of non-secular approaches favoured by the various regimes of Pakistan from 1947 until today has augmented the sense of insecurity and instability in the country, particularly among the socially and ethnically marginalized communities. This study argues that the issue of religious militancy and violence can be successfully dealt with by introducing a secular order. It aims to develop a secular approach and mindset that will unshackle the process of conflict management in Pakistan, based on the experience of European, Turkish, Indian, and Indonesian experiments with secularism.

Avicenna's Deliverance: Logic,"This book offers for the first time a complete scholarly translation, commentary, and glossary in a modern European language of the logic section of Ibn Sina's (d. 1037 ce) very important compendium al-Najat (The Deliverance). The original, written in Arabic, is the product of the middle period of the most renowned Muslim philosopher and physician, known in the Latin West as Avicenna. Avicenna's logical system took as its starting point the Aristotelian and the Peripatetic tradition, but diverged from these in fascinating and original ways. The system presented by him became the standard of reference and focus of further elaboration, debate, and innovation in the Islamic scholarly tradition, deeply influencing both the 'traditional religious' sciences (such as theology and law) and the naturalized Greek system (such as metaphysics). Because the Najat is both comprehensive and relatively terse, this translation, which has been the diachronic subject of study in various madaris and has a number of attached commentaries and glossaries, will be useful to those who do not read Arabic, but who wish to gain an overview of Avicenna's logic.

Prison Narratives,"2nd Runner-up of the Karachi Literature Festival (KLF)-German Peace Prize for 2018  

The book is based on a series of diary entries of eighteen-year-old Akhtar Baloch, who was arrested for staging a hunger strike in Hyderabad against the brutal crackdown on students and activists protesting against the then military regime of Yahya Khan (1969&ndash;71). It comprises the author&rsquo;s experiences during her year-long incarceration at Hyderabad and Sukkur jails of Pakistan in 1970. Initially locked up in the Hyderabad Jail, Baloch continued with her hunger strike, which resulted in her being sentenced to a year&rsquo;s imprisonment at the Sukkur Jail by the military courts. Powerful and inspirational, Baloch&rsquo;s story provides an unparalleled insight into the fabric of the Pakistani society of that time as portrayed through the women prisoners&rsquo; tales of hardship and injustice.
Author Description  

Born in Hyderabad, Sindh, on 16 December 1952, Akhtar Baloch became a political activist while she was still a student. She has been a part of important political and social movements such as the Movement for Restoration of Democracy (MRD). She also represented Pakistan at the 1986 International Women&rsquo;s Conference in Moscow, in which women leaders from all over the world participated. Baloch continues to raise her voice for the defence of democratic values and has written on social issues affecting indigenous people in the national press for the last thirty years. She has also taught political science at college and university levels.

Using several hitherto unpublished materials from the archives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army, as well as interviews with key military and political figures in Pakistan and the United States, he sheds light not only on the Pakistan Army and its US connections but also on Pakistan as a key Muslim country in one of the world&rsquo;s toughest neighbourhoods. In doing so, he lays bare key facts about Pakistan&rsquo;s numerous wars with India and its many rounds of political musical chairs, as well as the Kargil conflict of 1999. He then draws lessons from this history that may help Pakistan end its wars within and create a stable political entity.  

This second edition comprises an updated preface which summarizes the period of tumult and the significant transformation that both Pakistan and its army have undergone in the last decade.

Negotiating the Siege of the LAL MASJID,"In January 2007, the students of Lal Masjid (Red Mosque) took over the Children&rsquo;s Library in Islamabad in protest against the Government of Pakistan&rsquo;s decision to demolish mosques and seminaries built illegally on government land. After six months of escalating tensions, the crisis culminated in an eight-day siege and eventually ended by an armed assault resulting in over a hundred casualties and even more injured. This tragic outcome of the standoff had a devastating spillover effect as it turned into a rallying cry for Islamist militancy in the country. Based on extensive field research including interviews with key actors on all sides, this book provides an in-depth analytical account of the events that unfolded during the siege, with specific emphasis on the successes and failures of the negotiation process. It outlines important lessons and practical guidelines for crisis negotiators, incident commanders, and political decision-makers in order to provide them with the necessary tools to manage possible similar crises in the future more effectively.  

This book should be read by everyone who want to understand how effective negotiations can achieve better outcomes, if fully understood and supported by government decision-makers.&rsquo;

The Federal Cabinet of Pakistan,"This book explores the role of the federal cabinet of Pakistan in the decision-making and policy-formulation processes from 1947 to 1977. It challenges the common perception that the federal cabinet was a voiceless institution and only the military and civil bureaucracies played a pivotal role in the decision-making process. The book also highlights how all three institutions, including the civil and military bureaucracies and the cabinet were effective&mdash;besides a few prominent individuals&mdash;especially in political and economic matters.  

The book utilizes newly declassified cabinet files, which include minutes of cabinet meetings, decisions taken by various cabinets, and the working papers and summaries presented to them by ministries on important issues, to conclude that the role of the cabinet as an institution in strengthening democracy in the country was a mixed one. Democracy was reinforced by allowing ministers, representing different shades of opinion and social groups, to share power by coming to a consensus on vital issues with the head of government. However, the cabinet&rsquo;s undemocratic decisions, such as the use of the military or dismissal of the provincial governments and governors, weakened democracy.

Surkh Salam,"Pakistan today stands at a critical juncture in its short history of existence. While much has been written about Pakistan, little is known about post-Partition communism or left-leaning politics in the country, which played a key role in shaping Pakistani politics today. Kamran Asdar Ali here presents the first extensive look at the communist and working class movement in Pakistan. The author critically engages with the history of Pakistan&rsquo;s early years, paying special attention to the rise and fall of the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP), from Partition in 1947 to the aftermath of Bangladesh&rsquo;s independence in 1971.  

Since its formation in 1947 as a homeland for South Asian Muslims, Pakistan has been a configuration of shifting alliances and competing political and social ideologies. The country has experienced three military takeovers and is plagued with geopolitical conflict&mdash;from Kashmir to Baluchistan to Waziristan. While these aspects of Pakistan make headlines, in order to understand the complexities of these events, it is vital to understand the state&rsquo;s relationship throughout history with its divergent political and ethnic voices. While the history of Pakistan is often viewed through the lense of unified Muslim nationalism, the author explores the history of Pakistan&rsquo;s often tense relationship among various ethnic groups. Shedding light on a vital and little-researched aspect of Pakistan&rsquo;s history, this book shows that military coups, Islamic radicalization, and terrorist activities do not constitute the sum total of Pakistan&rsquo;s history, that its history includes the activities and contributions of communist intellectuals and activists.  

&lsquo;A work of exceptional importance. The author has combined archival unearthing with fieldwork that includes interviews with both elite actors and non-elite participants in organized leftist movements. Pakistan today is usually understood through the lens of terrorism, Islamism and the jockeying for power by groups that are seen to be either religious, or based upon ethnic affiliations. This book powerfully demonstrates that an organized and intellectual left was formative of intellectual life in Pakistan, and provided a defining affiliation for important thinkers and activists of diverse backgrounds.'</br>  Iftikhar Dadi, Department of History of Art, Cornell University  

&lsquo;This absorbing history of the forgotten hopes and struggles of the shortlived left in the new country of Pakistan is particularly poignant. It will be welcomed not only by scholars interested in leftist and working-class history, but also by those seeking to understand Cold War politics as they played out worldwide. Asdar Ali throws a wide net, including archives, memoirs, interviews and literary artifacts. More power to his hope that recovering a fuller understanding of Pakistan&rsquo;s past might reignite a lost vision of democracy and social justice today.&rsquo;</br>  Barbara Metcalf, Professor Emerita of History, University of California Davis  

&lsquo;Meticulously detailed and conceptually rigorous, beautifully written. A historical anthropology of the present, Communism in Pakistan unpacks the stories tucked into political detritus and remaindered memories &ndash; a must read.&rsquo;</br>  Geeta Patel, Associate Professor, Department of Middle Eastern and South Asian Languages and Cultures, University of Virginia  

&lsquo;At the centre of Communism in Pakistan is a valuable and important idea &ndash; a reading of Pakistan&rsquo;s history that complicates the dominant narrative&rsquo;s overwhelming emphasis on religion, Islamic radicalism, insurgencies and military rulers. By bringing into picture the little-known history of Pakistan&rsquo;s fledgling communists, the manuscript enriches our knowledge of the different layers of its political and intellectual existence&hellip; unusual and illuminating.&rsquo;</br>  Gyan Prakash, Dayton-Stockton Professor of History, Princeton University  

&lsquo;Communism in Pakistan is an account of the subterranean history of the Left in the formative decades of that country. His alternative history of the period &ndash; incisive, subtle, and poignant &ndash; reclaims a largely forgotten past for the present and the future. The book&rsquo;s intrepid and imaginative labour in piecing together the vibrant political culture of communism and working-class politics in Pakistan makes it both a substantive contribution and a critical historiographical intervention.&rsquo;</br>  Mrinalini Sinha, Alice Freeman Palmer Professor of History, University of Michigan

Old World Empires,"Recipient of the Higher Education Commission’s (HEC) award for ‘Best Book Publication in Social Sciences, 2013-2014’  
  This book provides a one-volume historical survey of the origins, development, and nature of state power. It demonstrates that Eurasia is home to a dominant tradition of arbitrary rule mediated through military, civil, and ecclesiastical servants, and a marginal tradition of representative and responsible government through autonomous institutions. The former tradition finds expression in hierarchically organized and ideologically legitimated continental bureaucratic states while the latter manifests itself in the state of laws. In recent times, the marginal tradition has gained in popularity and has led to continental bureaucratic states attempting to introduce democraticand constitutional reforms. These attempts have rarely altered the actual manner in which power is exercised by the state and its elites given the deeper and historically rooted experience of arbitrary rule. Far from being remote, the arbitrary culture of power that emerged in many parts of the world continues to shape the fortunes of states. To ignore this culture of power and the historical circumstances that have shaped it comes at a high price, as indicated by the ongoing democratic recession and erosion of liberal norms within states that are democracies.

Pakistan: The Garrison State,"This study seeks to solve the following puzzle: In 1947, the Pakistan military was poorly trained and poorly armed. It also inherited highly vulnerable territory vis-à-vis the much bigger India, aggravated because of serious disputes with Afghanistan. Defence and security were therefore issues that no Pakistan government, civil or military, could ignore. The military did not take part in politics directly until 1958, although it was called upon to restore order in 1953 in the Punjab province. Over the years, the military, or rather the Pakistan Army, continued to grow in power and influence, and progressively became the most powerful institution. Moreover, it became an institution with de facto veto powers at its disposal to overrule other actors within society including elected governments. Simultaneously, it began to acquire foreign patrons and donors willing to arm it as part of the Cold War competition (the United States), regional balance-of-power concerns (China), and ideological contestants for leadership over the Muslim world (Saudi Arabia, to contain Iranian influence). A perennial concern with defining the Islamic identity of Pakistan, exacerbated by the Afghan jihad, resulted in the convergence of internal and external factors to produce the ‘fortress of Islam’ self-description that became current in the early twenty-first century. Over time, Pakistan succumbed to extremism and terrorism within and was accused of being involved in similar activities within the South Asian region and beyond. Such developments have been ruinous to Pakistan’s economic and democratic development. The following questions are posed to shed further light: 1. What is the relationship between the internal and external factors in explaining the rise of the military as the most powerful institution in Pakistan? 2. What have been the consequences of such politics for the political and economic development in Pakistan? 3. What are the future prospects for Pakistan? A conceptual and theoretical framework combining the notion of a post-colonial state and Harold Lasswell’s concept of a garrison state is propounded to analyse the evolution of Pakistan as a fortress of Islam.

"Women, Healthcare, and Violence in Pakistan","Seeking to explore the plight of female healthcare practitioners in the country, Sara Rizvi Jafree&rsquo;s Women, Healthcare, and Violence in Pakistan is an examination of the South Asian cultural approach towards the traditional and historical working woman, particularly the healthcare professional. The book describes the laws that protect or harm such women in the workplace, and the real perils of physical and verbal harassment that they face during their service. Imbued with deep insights into the role of women in Islam, their socialization and the threats to healthcare professionals like nurses, doctors, and lady health workers, this book presents anecdotes based on ethnographic research and factual knowledge which makes it an impressive resource for understanding this social issue. Exploring the perpetration of brutality through victims&rsquo; testimonies, the author successfully paints a panorama on the theme of workplace cruelty, an important factor in the current discourse in Pakistan on this issue.

Cinema and Society,"The first of its kind, this book presents a wide selection of scholarly research, literary essays, memoirs, polemics, journalistic writings, and rare visual material relating to film and cinephilia in Pakistan. Much of the content is historically significant and includes annotated abridgements of rare and out-of-print publications on the film industry&rsquo;s early years in Lahore, Karachi, and Dhaka. Broad in temporal scope, Cinema and Society encompasses the &lsquo;golden age&rsquo; of Urdu cinema, Punjabi and Pashto popular film since the 1980s, as well as more recent developments relating to the &lsquo;revival&rsquo; of filmmaking in Pakistan. Aesthetics, technology and cinematic form are addressed in studies of individual films as well as wider explorations of diverse genres such as melodrama, horror, and action. Film content, production, exhibition, and distribution are analysed in relation to political, historical, and social change. Of the numerous issues tackled, nationalism, class, religious identity, violence, gender and sexuality, language, ethnicity, and urbanization are just a few. Also noteworthy are discussions of Indian cinema from a Pakistani perspective and the placement of film within its broader relationship to literature, theatre, music, and other media. Together with richly evocative photo essays that document the little known working lives of filmmaking casts and crews, Cinema and Society establishes Pakistani film and cinephilia as national and regional phenomena worthy of global attention.  

&nbsp;  

Amid clear signs of a turnaround in Pakistan&rsquo;s long-suffering film industry, this eclectic but well conceived collection of essays is a most timely and welcome contribution. Covering a wide range of social issues that have been depicted on celluloid since the creation of the country in 1947, this anthology is a must read for anyone interested in Pakistani culture and cinema from both a historical and comparative perspective.

Managing Piety,"The shrine of Ali Hujwiri (known as Data Ganj Bakhsh) in Lahore, Pakistan, is one of South Asia’s most important Sufi sites. Based on original material gathered by the author, the book gives an account of various developments associated with this shrine, with a particular focus on the relationship between the state, public space, the secular, and the religious. It also gives detailed accounts of the economy, management, and social impact of the shrine. This study is a significant contribution, especially because it fills the lacuna on information available on Sufism in South Asia, particularly in Pakistan. No in-depth study in English of the Data Ganj Bakhsh shrine has been conducted previously, and hence this book may be considered as pioneering work on the topic.

"Masculinity, Sexuality, and Illegal Migration","2nd Runner-up of the Karachi Literature Festival (KLF)-German Peace Prize for 2017  

Challenging the idea that labour migration is driven purely by rational economic forces, this book makes use of extensive new data to explore migration, human smuggling and illegal work. In a compelling exploration of global smuggling networks, illegal border-crossings and the subterranean world of Europe&rsquo;s informal economy, the author links migration to risky economic behaviour and erotic male desire. Based on interviews with successive waves of Pakistani immigrants in the UK and Italy, together with ethnographic fieldwork amongst immigration officials and smugglers in Pakistan, Masculinity, Sexuality, and Illegal Migration spans numerous regions, cities, continents and seas. Drawing on psychoanalysis to examine the role of masculinity in the decision to migrate, the author provokes a more complex debate about the causes and consequences of global migration.

Honour Killing,"Honour killing is a premeditated killing of a girl or woman who is perceived to have besmirched her family’s honour by her sexual conduct. It is committed by the accused woman’s male kin in the name of restoring the family’s honour. The genesis of honour killing is deeply rooted in history and has been linked by various scholars with ascendant patriarchal structures in human societies. It is not peculiar to particular geographical regions or belief systems. A large number of honour killings have been reported, whether in the past or currently, from the Mediterranean region and Latin American and some Muslim societies. Pakistan has one of the highest incidences of honour killing in the contemporary world but scholarly research conducted on the subject has been extremely limited. This book explores the various contexts in which men commit honour killing in Pakistan, and analyses the discourses that deal with it. As a hermeneutic and critical study, Honour Killing borrows from theorists and philosophers as diverse as Gebser, Foucault, Barthes, Riceour, Gramsci, Said, and Spivak. Contextualizing and analysing the various representative discourses in Pakistan, it comes to some understanding of the possible cultural, religious, and historical reasons that create the exigency for men to kill a female member of their own family. It looks at honour killing as a message in several contexts of Pakistani national life and analyses how these messages are communicated and towards what rhetorical ends.
Author Description  Amir Hamid Jafri earned degrees in Engineering, Business Management, and Rhetoric from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore; the University of Central Oklahoma, Edmond, USA; and the University of Texas Pan-American, Edinburg, USA. During the course of his doctoral studies at the University of Oklahoma, he read Hermeneutics with Professor Eric Kramer—and it was during the course of their reading of the German philosopher Jean Gebser’s The Ever-Present Origin, that Amir started exploring and working towards an understanding of the sedimented nature of the genesis of honour killing. Gebser’s theory of structures of human consciousness provided him with elaborate elucidations of the vexing dilemma. Honour Killing is a reworking of the original doctoral dissertation submitted to the Graduate Faculty at the University of Oklahoma.   During the last dozen or so years, Amir had taught various topics under the rubrics of Communication, Culture, Gender, and Rhetoric at the University of Texas, the University of Oklahoma, and Davis & Elkins College, USA.

From Stasis to Mobility,"This book takes into account the confluence of different factors in studying pressures on, and prospects for, the mobility of Arab Muslim women. Saiyma Aslam discusses Arab Muslim feminism as a travelling theory which is deeply sensitive to global realities. She calls for a challenge to the long-celebrated myths and ideologies that have circulated within or outside the Muslim world regarding the status and role of Arab Muslim women. The book considers their lived reality as diverse, fluid, and marked by heterogeneity. It explores the works of two writers, the Moroccan sociologist Fatima Mernissi and the Egyptian novelist Nawal El Saadawi, who call attention to the stasis in domestic gender relations and the processes of change under global restructuring.
Author Description  

Dr Saiyma Aslam is Assistant Professor in English Literature at International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan, where she also teaches modern drama, modern fiction, postcolonial literature, South Asian literature, and globalization. She is a researcher in Postcolonial Studies and English Literature, with a focus on travelling theory, mobility, globalization, and Islamic feminism.

PURDAH and POLYGAMY,"Originally published in 1944 by Hosali Press, Bangalore, this book is believed to be one of the first full-length English language novel by an Indian Muslim woman in the pre-Partition era. It has clear links with the biting criticism in the feminist Urdu fiction of writers such as Ismat Chughtai and Rashid Jahan. It mounts a scathing attack on the traditional systems of purdah and polygamy in which a man is treated as a virtual god and women, who are often barely literate, as chattel. Through its ironic tone, the novel demonstrates the corrupting influence of this patriarchal system and its power to warp the lives of the women who live under it.  

For this historically significant work, Jessica Berman of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, USA, has written the Introduction and provided contextual footnotes for the text. Also included are essays by literary critic Muneeza Shamsie (International Advisory Board, Journal of Postcolonial Writing) and academics, Suvir Kaul (University of Pennsylvania) and Arif Zaman (London School of Business and Management).  

&lsquo;This is a ground breaking novel, a pioneering work of feminist fiction and of particular significance in the literary history of South Asian English literature.&rsquo;

A Bad Woman’s Story,"This book is Kishwar Naheed&rsquo;s response to those who are quick to label a woman as bad. It is a searing indictment of a society that uses customs, religion, and even brute force to keep women down. She hits out hard and fearlessly at social and political injustices and at the materialism and sham religiosity she sees around her. It is what you would expect of one of Pakistan&rsquo;s leading feminist poets who is known for her defiance and outspokenness inspite of being born to a conservative family in pre-partition India. Rich in literary, historical, and cultural allusions, A Bad Woman&rsquo;s Story is written in a punchy, witty style that keeps the reader engaged and entertained throughout the book.
Author Description

A Rebel and her Cause,"Despite a brief and slender literary career, Rashid Jahan blazed like a meteor in the progressive firmament of pre- and post-Independence India. Doctor, writer, political activist, and a crusading member of the Communist Party of India (CPI), Rashid Jahan was radical in a way that defied all expectations—from her social class, her comrades, her peers, and colleagues. In a remarkably perceptive, richly detailed account of this pioneering woman, Rakhshanda Jalil offers readers an unusual document: a warm and informed biography—based on archival material, extensive interviews, and critical commentaries—together with fine translations of Rashid Jahan’s best known stories and plays. Through a subtle counterpointing of Rashid Jahan’s political purpose with her literary and professional skills and sensibility, Jalil paints an arresting portrait of a woman deeply and passionately engaged with the great debates of her time: fascism, imperialism, nationalism, socialism, and feminism. This intense engagement is reflected in every facet of her life and literature, as they unfold here in vivid and compelling prose.
Author Description  Rakhshanda Jalil is a writer, critic, and literary historian. Her published work comprises edited anthologies. Among them are a selection of Pakistani women writers entitled, Neither Night Nor Day; and Invisible City,  a collection of essays on Delhi. She is co-author of Partners in Freedom: Jamia Millia Islamia, and Journey to a Holy Land: A Pilgrim’s Diary. She is also a well-known translator, with eight published translations of Munshi Premchand, Asghar Wajahat, Saadat Hasan Manto, Shahryar, Intezar Hussain, and Phanishwarnath Renu. Rakhshanda runs an organization called Hindustani Awaaz devoted to the popularization of Hindi-Urdu literature and culture. Her debut collection of fiction, Release & Other Stories, was published in 2011.

"The Life of Muhammad","Professor Guillaume&rsquo;s translation of Ibn Ishaq&rsquo;s Sirat Rasul Allah is now reissued. The translator used Ibn Hisham&rsquo;s abridgement and also included many additions and variants found in the writings of early authors. The book thus presents in English practically all that is known of the life of the Prophet.</p>  

In the introduction, the translator discusses the character of the Sira in the light of the opinion of early Arabian scholars, noting especially the difficulties of the poetry. As the earliest monument of Arabian prose literature, the Sira remains a work of the first importance.

"Pirani &amp; Other Short Stories","Pirani &amp; Other Short Stories is an English translation of Jamal Abro&rsquo;s collection of short stories published originally&nbsp; in the Sindhi language. Abro is considered to be amongst the best writers in Sindhi. The book comprises sixteen short stories that capture the essence of the land and the people of rural Sindh. Pirani &amp; Other Short Stories arrests the reader&rsquo;s interest with its diversity, specific characteristics, and penetrating depiction of Sindh&rsquo;s social order. These classic short stories are accompanied by an informative introduction exploring the background of the&nbsp; stories and appreciating the significance of the finer points of the plot and the rendition. The work also includes two enlightening profiles of the author. The translation remains faithful to the style and mode of the original Sindhi text and adds to the authenticity of the narrative. This book certainly fills a gap in the dearth of accessible Sindhi literature available to the English readership.  

&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know who made the distinction that poetry dances while prose walks. While reading Pirani, I felt that even prose can dance.&rsquo;  

&ndash; Shaikh Ayaz  

&nbsp;&lsquo;Jamal [Abro] was a legend in his lifetime. He will remain a legend. His writings are the vowels of contemporary Sindhi literature. His brilliant mastery of the short story writing is simple, moving, and long lasting. He opened up new and vast perspectives; writing classics that demand constant re-reading.&rsquo;  

&ndash; Hamid Akhund
Author Description  

Jamal Abro was born in May 1924 at Sangi, a small village in Mehar Taluka, Sindh, Pakistan. He completed his matriculation from Bombay University (1941) and studied at the Bahauddin College in Junagadh, Gujarat. He graduated with a degree in law from Shahani Law College, Larkana (1948) and began his career as a lawyer.

It portrays how this impacts their lives in the long run. This narrative is explored through the relationship of three sisters and how they are stuck in the existential whirlpool of life.
Author Description  

Ibn-e-Saeed (Mirza Hasan Askari) was born on 12 December 1924 in Ludhiana. His schooling was received from the Anglo-Arabic School, Darya Ganj, Delhi. He then spent two years at the Anglo-Arabic College before completing his BA from Lucknow University. In 1944, he returned to Delhi and joined the ISPR. As a captain, he was posted to Japan and Singapore during World War II. After demobilization, he joined the daily Dawn Office in Delhi. Following Partition, he moved to Lahore and joined Radio Pakistan News Organization. He spent time in Paris and Delhi as Press Minister and, after retirement, joined Dawn as a journalist and was also on the editorial board. He wrote short stories under the pseudonym Ibn-e-Saeed from the late 1930s to the early 1960s. To his credit are two novellas and approximately thirty-eight short stories, which are so varied in terms of style and content that they make very exciting reading. The ownership of his identity as an early Indian Muslim and then a Pakistani is conveyed strongly and his views on world politics and post colonialism are put forth lucidly.

"Hybrid Tapestries","Hybrid Tapestries provides an extensive historical map of Pakistani English literature: it traces the narrative to its multiple origins, including pre-colonial and colonial contacts, and moves across the twentieth century to extraordinary new talent. The book singles out thirteen innovative writers for a detailed chapter on each, beginning with those who became Pakistanis after Partition (such as Shahid Suhrawardy and Ahmed Ali) but who had published major works prior to Independence. Due acknowledgement is also given to the two forgotten writers of that era: Atiya and Samuel Fyzee Rahamin. Pioneering contemporary authors, from Zulfikar Ghose and Taufiq Rafat to Bapsi Sidhwa, Sara Suleri, and Hanif Kureishi, are discussed in detail.  

The book encompasses poetry, fiction, drama, and life-writing. It includes and unites a wide range of English language writers in Pakistan with those living in the diaspora. Poets Alamgir Hashmi, Imtiaz Dharker, and Moniza Alvi; novelists Kamila Shamsie, Mohsin Hamid, and Uzma Aslam Khan; short story writers Aamer Hussein, Daniyal Mueenuddin, and Jamil Ahmed; playwrights Sayeed Ahmad, Rukhsana Ahmed, and Ayub Khan-Din are all discussed here. These are underpinned by an extensive discussion on essays, letter writing, and memoirs, including the letters of Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Alys Faiz; essays of Anwer Mooraj, Moni Mohsin, and Eqbal Ahmed; travelogues of Salman Rashid; and memoirs of Firoz Khan Noon, Tehmina Durrani, Kamran Nazeer, and others. The book also brings new perspectives and critical writings on the diverse sociopolitical reasons for the emergence of a Pakistani national literature in English.

"Tum Kabeer","This book contains Fahmida Riaz’s poems composed between 2000 and 2015. Fahmida Riaz has been a political activist since she was a student and a literary pioneer of the women’s liberation movement in Pakistan. From the outset, her choice of themes, diction, allusion, and similes, broke out of the inhibitions imposed on her gender. Her poetry has won her many admirers, especially among modernists and younger readers. Her protest poetry caught the imagination of her generation. As this generation grew, so did her popularity and critical esteem. Her aspirations, which are both for seeking a democratic dispensation and women’s liberation, invigorate her verse, making it a powerful medium of protest. Beneath the politico-social overtones, one discerns the lyricism of an accomplished poet. All her political and feminist aspirations are reflected in her poetry, of which she has published several volumes. She has also employed her talent by translating into Urdu, the Persian poetry of Rumi and Farogh Farrukhzad, and the Sindhi poetry of Shaikh Mubarak Ayaz.
Author Description  

Fahmida Riaz is a well-known Urdu author, poet, and feminist. Born in 1946 in Meerut, India, educated in Hyderabad and London, and living in Karachi, she has written poetry and short stories since the age of 15 and has been involved in social and political activities since her student days. She has seen publication of four volumes of her poetry, three novels, including Godavari, the English translation of which is also published by OUP Pakistan, and a collection of short stories, in addition to the Urdu translation of some verses from Shaikh Ayaz. She has also translated Rumi into Urdu.  

Fahmida Riaz&rsquo;s first collection Badan Dareeda appeared when she was 22, and was responsible for creating a stir in literary circles. Fahmida Riaz is among the front rank of authors and poets in Urdu. Besides being a poet, she is also an unrelenting social critic and has been active in several human rights movements. She was among the writers who campaigned against Gen. Ziaul Haq&rsquo;s military rule and the execution of Z. A. Bhutto, and had to suffer the wrath of the authorities and a period of self-exile. Fahmida Riaz has spent years abroad: in London, working for the BBC; then in India as a political exile. She is also the author of several short stories and travelogues in Urdu, including Zinda Bahar Lane about Bangladesh. She has travelled widely and lectured at universities and cultural forums in England and the USA. Fahmida Riaz was given the Hemmet-Hellman award by Human Rights Watch, New York, in 1997 and the Kamal-i-Fun award in Pakistan in 2016.

Pakistan,"If Pakistan is to preserve all that is good about the country, it must face the deterioration of its social and political institutions. Sidestepping easy headlines to identify Pakistan&rsquo;s true dangers, this volume revisits the major turning points and trends of Pakistani history over the past six decades. While Ian Talbot&rsquo;s study centres on Pakistan&rsquo;s many failures&mdash;the collapse of stable governance, the drop in positive political and economic development, and, most of all, the unrealised goal of a Muslim state as envisaged by the Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah&mdash;this book unequivocally affirms the country&rsquo;s potential for a positive reawakening. These failures were not preordained, Talbot argues. His sensitive historical approach makes it clear that favourable opportunities still remain for Pakistan, in which the state has a chance to reclaim its priorities and institutions and re-establish political and economic sustainability.

"A History of the All-India Muslim League 1906-1947","This work presents an exhaustive study of the growth and rise of the leading Muslim political party of the South Asian subcontinent—the All-India Muslim League. Founded in December 1906, it began as an elite party, limiting its membership to 400 for the whole subcontinent and charging very high registration and annual fees. It passed through several phases in its history, articulating Muslim demands at the all-India and provincial levels. Except for short intervals of dormancy, the processes of its membership enrolment and party elections from the grassroots to the central level were amazingly regular and quite remarkable. The climax of its activities used to be all-India annual and special sessions. Muslims would attend these sessions from the remotest corner of the subcontinent. During its final phase, Quaid-i-Azam M.A. Jinnah transformed it into a mass party, which had active branches in all the provinces of British India. Despite limited resources in funding and propaganda, the party successfully mobilized the Muslim masses of every school of thought in support of its demand for Pakistan. Its lasting contribution is the formation of Pakistan, achieved within a decade of commencing this phase of its historic struggle. Based on the Muslim League and other contemporary primary sources,   the author gives a comprehensive account of this remarkable phenomenon of a Muslim political party.

"Legends of the Indus","The five legends included in this volume are drawn from the main regions of the Indus Valley, which stretches from the Himalayas to the desert sands of the Arabian Sea, through a landscape of breathtaking beauty and contrast in what is now Pakistan.  

&nbsp;Adam &amp; Durkhane from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  

Sohni &amp; Mahiwal from Punjab</br>  
Heer &amp; Ranjha from Punjab</br>  
Omar &amp; Marui from Balochistan</br>  
Sassui &amp; Punhun from Sindh</br>

Traditionally told by local bards for entertainment and education at community gatherings, these folktales have been reinterpreted by each subsequent generation in verse and song, providing material for the great Sufi poets as well as musicians, visual artists and craftsmen.  

As part of her lifelong interest in preserving the rich cultural heritage and diversity of the Indus region, Samina Quraeshi (1944-2013) began to record and document different interpretations of these folk tales in the early 2000s. Inspired by her mentor Dr. Annemarie Schimmel&rsquo;s interpretation of these folkstories as Sufi parables, Quraeshi created a contemporary text inspired by this oral, poetic, musical and artistic tradition.  

Originally published by Asia Ink in 2004, this new edition fulfills Quraeshi&rsquo;s plans to provide a new volume of these classic tales, accessible to a new generation of readers in Pakistan and around the world. Featuring a new preface by her daughter Sadia Shepard, the Oxford University Press edition is designed by Saima Zaidi and illustrated with paintings from the collection of The Lahore Museum.
Author Description  

Throughout her career, author, artist, and educator, Samina Quraeshi (1944&ndash;2013), worked across her native Pakistan and her adopted home in the United States to create a unique body of work informed by both places. Both her visual art and her four award-winning books on Pakistan:Legacy of the Indus, Lahore: The City Within, Legends of the Indus, and Sacred Spaces: A Journey with the Sufis of the Indus, took inspiration from the material and spiritual cultures of the Indus Valley.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Shaifta","This is a representative selection of Nawab Mustafa Khan Shaifta&rsquo;s poetry. Shaifta wrote his verse both in Urdu and Persian, and assumed two poetic names, Shaifta for Urdu verse, and Hasrati for his Persian poetry. He also wrote a history of Urdu poets under the title: Gulshan-e-Baykhaar. Half way through life Shaifta turned away from romance to religion. He undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca which was completed in two years. He was a patron of poets and his house was the hub of poetic activity, a favourite venue for Mushairas. His poetry, though it deals with the conventional themes of love and romance, is remarkable for the sincerity and frankness of sentiment, alacrity and aptness of style, a pleasing musicality, and an easy accessibility. Among the famous men who admired his poetic genius may be included Ghalib, Hali and Hasrat Mohani.

"Modern Urdu Short Stories from Pakistan","This anthology brings together English translations of twenty-six Urdu short stories by renowned Pakistani writers. Stories included in the anthology were written between 1947 and the present time. Authors range from the celebrated Saadat Hasan Manto and Intizar Husain to Dr Shershah Syed and&nbsp;Zafar Mehmood.  

Not all of these stories are necessarily the most famous works of their authors, and most of them have not been translated into English before. However, their exquisite depiction of diverse experiences and social realities justifies calling them unforgettable gems of Urdu short story writing.  

Selected and translated by Amina Azfar, these stories will delight the general reader and will also be useful to students and scholars studying South Asian literature, culture, and history.

Pupil&rsquo;s Book 3 widens the student&rsquo;s knowledge of geography through case studies of countries around the world, with special focus on Islamic nations.

"Ibn e Khaldun and his Muqaddimah","Ibn e Khaldun and his Muqaddimah is the fifth offering in the Literary Heritage Series for Young Readers, following Our Shaikh Saadi, The Simurgh and the Birds, Our Bhittai, and Our Rumi. While the others are titles about world-famous poets, Abdul Rahman Ibn e Khaldun was a Muslim intellectual who should be a source of inspiration for our young generation.  

A historiographer and historian, Ibn e Khaldun is known as the founding father of modern sociology, the science of demography, natural sciences, politics, economics, and development of civilizations. The Muqaddimah, meaning &lsquo;An Introduction&rsquo;, was written for a history book towards the end of his long and varied career. However, as it contained the very essence of his life&rsquo;s experiences, observations, and analysis, it outshone the rest of his scholarly work. Today, Ibn e Khaldun is universally acknowledged and is important for our young generation as a link between the past and the present.  

The purpose of Ibn e Khaldun and his Muqaddimah is mainly to introduce this remarkable and amazing Muslim intellectual to our young readers and help them know about his person, life, and works. Beautifully illustrated, this book will educate as well as fascinate its readers.  

The selection and compilation of the text has been done by Fahmida Riaz, an eminent poet and writer. Great care has been taken in selecting suitable material to appeal to the youth.

"From Mountains to Mangroves","Pakistan is a geographical gem&mdash;a land with the greatest change in elevation within any sovereign state on earth, from 0 metres at Sonmiani Bay to 8,611 metres at the summit of K-2. Such dramatic changes in altitude have resulted in incredibly diverse ecosystems with wildlife ranging from snow leopards up in the high mountains to marine turtles on the coast. This book, written by the pioneering Pakistani environmental journalist, Rina Saeed Khan, is an attempt to highlight some of this amazing diversity. From Mountains to Mangroves informs the reader about the many inspiring stories of conservation activities taking place across Pakistan. The sixteen stories in the book are penned in an engaging, personal manner with rigorous research endorsed by WWF-Pakistan. An important record of the recent conservation history of Pakistan, these stories have been selected from the author&rsquo;s many travels over the past two decades to far-flung areas ranging from the Karakoram Mountains to the Makran Coast.

"Casebook on Corporate Governance and Management Practices in Pakistani Organizations","&ldquo;High quality governance and management of firms is critical for survival in the modern hyper- competitive world. As Pakistani firms prosper and scale up, the need for effective governance and management would only increase. This requires young and seasoned Pakistani managers to become aware of, properly understand, and master the challenges and complexities involved in these domains. While foreign textbooks on these topics are available, most Pakistani students and managers always decry the lack of local material which they find far more insightful and relevant. Through this book, Muntazar has very ably filled this gap. The book also contains rich cases on challenges faced in developing, managing, and recovering effective MIS systems using modern tools such as ERP systems. As an academic, I welcome this book as it would add tremendously to the local knowledge base. Faculty members teaching these topics at various Pakistani universities now have an effective pedagogical vehicle in their hands. Muntazar must be congratulated for putting his vast academic and practical experience to such good use for Pakistani students.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Muntazar Bashir Ahmed is one of Pakistan&rsquo;s most distinguished case writers. Over thirty years, he has contributed to a pedagogical change in business teaching in the country through the introduction of international quality cases in some of the more difficult subject areas. I cannot think of anyone who is better suited to write on these critical issues. This casebook on corporate governance is a must for any business school since it transcends borders and will be as exciting for a student in North America as much as it is essential for a student in South Asia. The case studies included in this volume are testimony to the unique cultural norms adopted by local organizations as well as the insightfulness of the analysis which has universal applications.&rdquo;

Ibn-e-Saeed (Mirza Hasan Askari) was born on 12 December 1924 in Ludhiana. His schooling was received from the Anglo-Arabic School, Darya Ganj, Delhi.

As a captain, he was posted to Japan and Singapore during World War II. After demobilization, he joined the daily Dawn Office in Delhi. Following Partition, he moved to Lahore and joined Radio Pakistan News Organization. He spent time in Paris and Delhi as Press Minister and, after retirement, joined Dawn as a journalist and was also on the editorial board. He wrote short stories under the pseudonym Ibn-e-Saeed from the late 1930s to the early 1960s. To his credit are two novellas and approximately thirty-eight short stories, which are so varied in terms of style and content that they make very exciting reading. The ownership of his identity as an early Indian Muslim and then a Pakistani is conveyed strongly and his views on world politics and post colonialism are put forth lucidly.

"Candles in the Dark","&nbsp;  

This book explains how some entities can survive and flourish in an institutional environment that is both fragile and hostile. Despite daunting odds, some institutions have managed to succeed and effectively deliver core services, earn legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, and forge resilience in the face of an otherwise tumultuous and prohibitive operational context. Nine Pakistani institutions from the public and private sectors, generally regarded as successful, have been selected for this research. These include the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Motorway Police, Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), Punjab Education Foundation, Edhi Foundation, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital, and Rescue 1122.  

The study&rsquo;s research results are based mostly on semi-structured interviews with members of the selected institutions including leaders, staff, and clients. In addition to the interviews, and where possible, a qualitative assessment has been made of how the organizational performances are perceived by key stakeholders and the general public.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam Munir Niazi","This is a representative selection of Munir Niazi&rsquo;s poetry. It includes not only those nazms and ghazals that are widely known and popular but also those that embodies his personal quest as a poet. Munir Niazi&rsquo;s poetry goes beyond a mere versification of thoughts. His poetry is multi-dimensioned; a kaleidoscope of meaning, feeling and sensation.&nbsp; His work expressed a new sensibility and experience of the milieu that not only established him as a trendsetting poet but also gained him popular readership amongst youth.&nbsp; His style and diction were different to his contemporaries, and this selection tries to capture that essence which set Munir Niazi&rsquo;s work apart from that of others.&nbsp; Even though the ghazal is generally a more popular form of poetry, when it comes to Munir Niazi, people remember his nazms&nbsp; equally, the latter being as frequently quoted and recited as the former.  </br>Munir Niazi was born in East Punjab in 1928 and later migrated to Pakistan. Migration and urban life crop up as recurrent themes in his poetry. He died on 26th December 2006. Twelve collections of his poetry have been published in Urdu and three collection of Punjabi poetry have also been published.

"The Country of First Boys","How do deprivations related to class, caste, and gender interrelate ?  

Why are our political leaders so good in saying what should be done without doing anything much about it?  

How should we think about Sanskrit and ancient India without adding religious colour?  

Why is it important to revive Nalanda, the world&rsquo;s oldest university?  

The Country of First Boys is Amartya Sen&rsquo;s intellectual journey through the past and present to seek an understanding of India&rsquo;s history and the demands of its future. The themes of these essays include the hardened and extreme nature of inequality in India, and what can be done about it. One of the many rewards of good schooling&mdash;denied to most Indians&mdash;includes the understanding that India is an integral part of a world civilization. Always sensitive to global communication and interaction, India&rsquo;s own contributions vary from the development of a multiplicity of astronomically reasoned calendars and the invention of games like chess to the establishment of the foundations of several branches of modern mathematics.  

In this collection, Sen examines justice, identity, deprivation, inequalities, gender politics, education, the media, and the importance of getting your priorities right. These are accessible yet pioneering essays that hold the kernel of many of his seminal works.
Author Description  One of the world’s foremost thinkers, AMARTYA SEN teaches economics and philosophy at Harvard University, and was earlier Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.

"Bulleh Shah","This book is a collection of poems by the great Sufi poet of Punjab, Bulleh Shah (1680–1758), translated into English by Taufiq Rafat, one of Pakistan’s premier English language poets.     Born Abdullah Shah, Bulleh Shah belonged to the oral tradition and his poems are primarily in Punjabi as well as in Siraiki. Bulleh Shah’s poetry is in the Kafi style, already established with the Sufis who preceded him, and extensively use the Rubbay (Quatrain) form. Several of his verses are an integral part of the traditional repertoire of Qawwali, the musical genre which represents the devotional music of the Sufis. Following the tradition of Sufi poetry, the poems in this collection refer to love of or for God, or the Mentor, or the desire for absorption in nature, described through symbolic references to local customs pertaining to weddings, funerals, journeys, and harvests.
Author Description  Playwright, translator, and poet, Taufiq Rafat (1927–1998) was regarded as one of the finest Pakistani poets writing in English. Postulating a fundamental ‘Pakistani Idiom’, he revolutionized English language writing in this country by adapting and naturalizing English to express the Pakistani experience.     Born in Sialkot in 1927, Rafat was educated at Dehra Dun, Aligarh, and Government College, Lahore. His work featured in all three of Oxford University Press’s early collections of Pakistani English poetry, First Voices (1964), Pieces of Eight (1970), and Wordfall (1976). He was published overseas in the celebrated literary-political journal, Encounter, as well as in Poems of the Commonwealth, and Mentor’s Modern Asian Literature. His first collection of poems, Arrival of the Monsoon, was published in 1985, and Taufiq Rafat: A Selection, was published as part of Oxford University Press’s Jubilee Series in 1997. Half Moon, his last collection of poems, appeared posthumously in 2009. His poems have been set in secondary school and college English courses in Africa, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as in the Intermediate English syllabi in the Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan.      Rafat’s renditions of Punjabi classics into English include, Puran Bhagat by Qadir Yar, and the poems of the great Sufi master Bulleh Shah.

"Zulfi Bhutto of Pakistan","No individual in the history of Pakistan—indeed, few people in modern history—have achieved greater popular power or suffered so ignominious a death as Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto’s political rise and fall was so meteoric that his name became a legend in the land he once ruled.    This volume traces the life of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, from the colourful days of his feudal ancestors to his imprisonment and hanging at the hands of a military dictator.    Bhutto was a charismatic and contradictory man. He climbed the heights of power with amazing swiftness, winning a seat in the central Cabinet of Pakistan at the unprecedented age of thirty. Wolpert weaves Pakistan’s turbulent politics and repeated wars with India together with Bhutto’s ambitious manoeuvring, tracing his rise as Foreign Minister, to the founding of his own political party, the PPP, and finally, leadership of the nation. The story of Bhutto’s sometimes inspiring and sometimes quixotic career is a fascinating one and Wolpert tells it brilliantly through Bhutto’s triumphant years in the mid-1970s, the military coup in 1977, and his treacherous imprisonment and execution in 1979.    Wolpert’s intensively researched, engagingly written account captures the scheming, the grandeur, and the contradictions of one of modern history’s most fascinating figures.

"Pakistan – A Dream Gone Sour","Fifty years after its creation, Pakistan continues its search for stability. In August 1947, at the time of independence, Pakistan symbolized the wishes and expectations of the Muslims of the subcontinent, united under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.  

In August 1997, there seems to be a crisis of public confidence in the country&rsquo;s future. The reality of today&rsquo;s Pakistan is very different from the dream. This book is in the main the story of six of Pakistan&rsquo;s Presidents&mdash;Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Z. A. Bhutto, Ziaul Haq, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and Farooq Leghari&mdash;each of whom has, in his own way, directly or indirectly, contributed to the sense of betrayal and loss of confidence that is prevalent in the country. The author also examines the question of where sovereignty really lies in Pakistan and analyses critically the roles not only for the six presidents, but also of politicians, bureaucrats, judiciary, and the armed forces, and concludes with an assessment of the implications for Pakistan&rsquo;s democracy of recent political events.

"INCOMPLETE  PARTITION","Seventy years on, the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan seems to be no nearer to a solution than it was in 1947 when the British Indian Empire ended with Partition. Alastair Lamb argues that in many ways the Kashmir question was a direct product of the process of Partition which in important respects was never completed; and any serious attempt at its resolution will inevitably involve a conscious effort to complete that process. This book expands greatly (and in places modifies) the material in the author’s previous book, Birth of a Tragedy: Kashmir 1947 and adds a detailed study of the treatment of the Kashmir issue by the United Nations during the course of the year 1948. He also considers the events of 1947 and 1948 in light of the current situation and explores the possibilities for some kind of settlement of the dispute which has so profoundly disrupted relations between India and Pakistan for virtually the entirety of their lives as sovereign states.

"We've Learnt Nothing from History","In this book, Air Marshal (Retired) M. Asghar Khan presents an insider's view of Pakistan's struggle for democracy from the 1960s to the present. The book expounds on the early entry of Pakistan's armed forces into the country's politics and the author's opposition to military rule that began in 1968 with the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy. This movement resulted in the ouster of President Muhammad Ayub Khan in 1969 after eleven years of military rule. The author describes his continued opposition to autocratic and dictatorial rule, especially General Yahya Khan's policy of brutal suppression through military action in East Pakistan. He also recounts his strong criticism of the General's refusal to hand over power to Sheikh Mujibur Rehman and the Awami League–winners of the first-ever free and fair general elections held in Pakistan. The author recalls Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's rise to political power during the 1970s, and General Ziaul Haq's dogmatic and iron-fisted military rule during the 1980s, and elaborates on some pertinent features of Pakistan's domestic and international situation. The book concludes with the author's assessment of General Pervez Musharraf's five years in power consequent upon the re-entry of the armed forces in the country's politics in 1999, after a brief and tumultuous interlude with democracy.

The reconciliation of basic Islamic principles with modernity has been a major challenge for Muslims over the last two centuries. This study uncovers the responses of Indian Muslims who were drawn to socialist ideas between the Bolshevik Revolution and Partition. From the Pan-Islamist muhajirin, who migrated to Soviet Central Asia during the Khilafat agitation of 1919&ndash;24, to the upper-class literary radicals of the Progressive Writers Movement of the 1930s and 1940s, socialism provided Muslim radicals with an intellectual toolkit for analysing their own society and constructing strategies for emancipation from Western oppression. In fact, the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity that existed within Islamic ideology encouraged Muslim socialists to embrace a secular mode of thinking. Recognizing these familiar strands in socialist theory legitimized their fascination with socialism. This book sheds light on the fact that religious and political separatism were not the only paths adopted by the Muslims of North India to move forward under colonial rule. 'It is an irony of history that those who lay the foundation of a movement are forgotten and fame comes to those who participate in the final phase of the struggle. Dr Khizar Ansari resurrects those forgotten people who fought against British Rule and disappeared in the mist of time. Dr Ansari vividly narrates their story, their ideals, dreams, sufferings, and hopes. It is well documented, well researched, and well presented.'

"The Punjab Bloodied, Partitioned and Cleansed","The Partition of India in 1947 resulted in the biggest forced migration in history—some 14 million people altogether of which 10 million were from the Punjab. This book is a holistic study of the first major case of ethnic cleansing after the Second World War. Besides shedding new light on the events through secret British reports, it also contains poignant accounts by eyewitnesses, survivors, and even participators in the carnage from both sides of the border. With interviewees from both India and Pakistan, the book aims to give a balanced account of Partition and show how religious differences are no bar to peaceful coexistence unless highlighted by divisive forces. It will be of immense interest to anyone even remotely curious about the happenings of the most traumatic event in recent Indian history.

"Ottoman Turkey, Atatürk, and Muslim South Asia","This book examines the South Asian perceptions of and responses to the political events that unfolded with the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire and the formation of the Turkish Republic by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Based on the updated version of the author's contributions to various journals and academic proceedings, the book analyses nineteenth-century pan-Islam in South Asia, and unfolds its expression in South Asia in the context of British and Allied policies towards the Turks. It also tries to explain why South Asians, with a little nudging from men like Iqbal and Jinnah, switched their sympathies from the Ottomans to the nationalists under Ataturk, and how they viewed the process of modernization in Turkey, in comparison with the Muslims of Afghanistan and Iran. Lastly, the book attempts to examine the enduring relevance of pan-Islam as a tool in the politics of Pakistan and ventures to measure its trajectory in the future, especially when Turkey today is gradually moving away from Ataturk's model of state and society. The research for this book was conducted in the archives and libraries of Pakistan, India, Turkey, and Britain.

"Willoughby's Minute","Willoughby’s Minute describes events that surround the 1842 Treaty of Nownahar.  Its focus is on how the indigenous sovereign Mir Ali Morad committed a fraud when he altered the treaty. Authored by John Pollard Willoughby, a career East India Company civil servant and Bombay Council Board member, the Minute provides an alternative genealogy to contextualize British debates about Sindh’s annexation. This genealogy does not focus on Britain’s aggressive anti-Russian imperial policy in Afghanistan (i.e., the Great Game).  Instead, it demonstrates how a local treaty—that did not involve the British directly—contextualizes Sindh’s annexation and the institutional relationship between civil and military authority within the East India Company.

"The Frontier Crimes Regulation","In the 1840s, as British Indian colonial authorities displaced the Sikh government in the Punjab districts bordering Afghanistan, they attempted to replicate a pattern of rule that evolved from their previous military occupations of the north Indian regions. Certain ‘structures of power’ and an ‘ideology of authority’ shaped a hierarchical relationship between the colonial state and regional societies. A crucial concern was to establish a law and order regime that minimized conflict and legitimated British authority. Across British India, through the implementation of police, judicial, and ideological structures, authorities asserted claims of colonial pre-eminence and a monopoly over coercive power.    This volume contains primary source documents—correspondence and regulations—related to the writing of the Punjab Frontier Crimes Regulation of 1887 for what was to become the British North-West Frontier Province and ensuing years of debate over the need for additional revisions. They document the complex colonial adaptation of legal codes and levers of power to control what were seen as archaic but enduring social, moral, and cultural norms based o n Pashtun customary social and devotional practices. Throughout this history, alternative voices disputed any claims to colonial legal or moral hegemony. Features of this history, including the latest version of the Frontier Crimes Regulation, continued into the early twenty-first century as active, highly debated features of state administrative policies.    In the years after September 11, 2001, a period of turmoil in Afghanistan and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, such debates were urgently continued, even as power relations meant they were less urgently acted upon.

"The All-India Muslim League, 1906-1947","In this book, the author takes Pakistan as a case study in a search for better definitions of nations and nationalism, arguing that it exhibits three essential ingredients which are: a distinctive integrated community, a particular set of circumstances, and purposeful leadership. She discusses all three elements within the local context, concentrating particularly on the evolving leadership role of the All-India Muslim League as evidenced in contemporary sources. The achievement of Pakistan was primarily the work of Muslim League leaders, and especially of the Quaid-i-Azam, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, but would have been impossible without a prior cohesive community and the stimulus of a neighbouring nationalism.

"Dead Reckoning","This ground-breaking book chronicles the 1971 war in South Asia by reconstituting the memories of those on opposing sides of the conflict.  The year 1971 was marked by a bitter civil war within Pakistan and war between India and Pakistan, backed respectively by the Soviet Union and the United States. It was fought over the territory of East Pakistan, which seceded to become Bangladesh. Through a detailed investigation of events on the ground, Sarmila Bose contextualises and humanises the war while analysing what the events reveal about the nature of the conflict itself.  The story of 1971 has so far been dominated by the narrative of the victorious side. All parties to the war are still largely imprisoned by wartime partisan mythologies. Bose reconstructs events through interviews conducted in Bangladesh and Pakistan, published and unpublished reminiscences in Bengali and English of participants on all sides, official documents, foreign media reports and other sources. Her book challenges assumptions about the nature of the conflict and exposes the ways in which the 1971 conflict is still being played out in the region.    ‘Combining rigorous scholarship and a passionate interest in setting the record straight, Dead Reckoning is the finest study yet of the social, cultural and political meaning of the 1971 East Pakistan/Bangladesh war. Sarmila Bose writes in the service of the truth. We are in her debt.’  –Stephen Cohen, author of The Idea of Pakistan

"Gondniwala Takiya","Gondniwala Takiyais a novel about fluctuating moral values and the evolving social milieu in rural Punjab of the early 20th century. A Takiya, or corner, was a reclusive place for hermits and Sufis, where they could retire for meditation. But the people of village too used to gather at the corner, either to meet the Sufis or to discuss matters of everyday life among themselves. Today, as a result of changing values and commercialisation, hardly any such &lsquo;corners&rsquo; are left anymore. Hence, the &lsquo;corner&rsquo; has a symbolic value in this novel.  

The work&rsquo;s depiction of rural Punjab is outstanding. It is one of the earliest Urdu novels to portray rural Punjab realistically. Sultan, the main character, returns to his village after a long time and is shocked to see that the corner that was shaded by a fig tree is no more. Sufi Nageena, who used to rule there, is gone and the people who surrounded the Sufi are nowhere to be seen. Although Sultan is happy with the clear progress that the village has made over these years, the deep sense of being an alien in his own village grips his heart.  

While it was Ghulam Abbas&rsquo;s short stories, such as Aanandi and Katba, which brought him fame and established him as a master of the Urdu short story, his novel Gondniwala Takiya, was also widely acclaimed.
Author Description

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Ada Jafarey","This is a representative selection of Ada Jafarey&rsquo;s poetry. Ada Jafarey was part of a traditionally conservative society where women were not permitted to think and express themselves independently. But she was bold enough to break with such attitudes. Despite having traditionalism ingrained in her personality, she chose to express herself as a modern poet. As early as 1950, she was recognized as theFirst Lady of Urdu Poetry. Her mother initially, and her husband Nurul Hasan Jafarey later, encouraged her to persist with her literary activities despite social difficulties. Ada Jafarey was a student of great poets like Akhtar Sheerani and Jafar Ali Khan Asar Lakhnavi, and had her poems corrected by them. Ada Jafarey writes in a gender-neutral mode, although her works include feminist themes, such as discrimination, dehumanisation of women, and their being viewed as sexual objects. Ada Jafarey wrote of her experiences as a wife and mother in a modified traditional idiom, but also noticed the lack of fulfilment that accompanied these relationships. She had mastered both forms of Urdu poetry,Nazm and Ghazal, but she also experimented with Azad Nazm, as well as Urdu Haikus.&nbsp; Her first ghazal was published in Akhtar Sheerani's magazine, Romaan, in 1945. Ada Jafarey published her first collection of poems, Main Saaz Dhoondti Rahi,&nbsp;in 1950. Her book, Ghazal Numa, containing short essays with short biographies and brief commentaries on the work of previous Urdu poets, was published in 1987. She has published five collections of Urdu poetry:Shahar e Dard, Ghazalan,Tum to Waaqif Ho!, Harf e Shanasai, Safar Baqi, and Mausam Mausam, in addition to her autobiography Jo Rahi So Bekhabri Rahi, and forty research papers.

"Urdu Adab Ki Tashkeel e Jadeed","This book follows from Nasir Abbas Nayyar&rsquo;s earlier work,in which he had written of the colonial impact on the making of the &lsquo;new Urdu literature&rsquo; of the 19th century, focusing on the power-seeking strategies of colonial rulers and seeking to analyse the response of Urdu writers towards these colonial strategies. In the present work, taking the concept of real and mythical identity from Nigerian author Chinua Achebe, Nayyar examines issues related to the conceptual and formal basis of modern Urdu literature. He develops his ideas across the panoply of modern Urdu writing, examining the patriotic poetry of Altaf Husain Hali and the conflict between the old and the new in Nazir Ahmad&rsquo;s novel Taubatannasooh from a postcolonial perspective. He regards Sir Sayyad Ahmed Khan and Akbar Allahabadi as key protagonists of modern Urdu literature and employs the symbols of the mythical Greek titans Prometheus and Epimetheus to interpret their contrasting roles in the reconstruction of Urdu literature.  

Moving to 20th century writing, Nayyar explains the role of Saadat Hassan Manto&rsquo;s socially marginal characters in destabilising a dominating centre. He sees the ambivalence in Miraji&rsquo;s poetry as a reaction to a nationalism which divides people on the basis of supposed identities. Finally, the author suggests that magical realism and &lsquo;the other&rsquo; have deep roots in the Urdu fiction produced after independence. Citing the examples of Manto&rsquo;s symbolist stories Farishta(Angel) and Phundanay (Tassels) and the surrealistic techniques employed in Quratulain Haider&rsquo;s Aag ka Darya (River of Fire), he feels that eastern traditions of fiction had formerly been possessed of a meta-realist vision. The revival of interest in the Dastan and Kathain post-independence Urdu fiction, such as in Intizar Husain&rsquo;s stories, can be interpreted as a reconstruction of a cultural identity mutilated by the colonial regime.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam:  Asghar Gondvi","This is a representative selection of Asghar Gondvi&rsquo;s poetry. His work based on philosophy and spiritualism brought a new colour to the poetic landscape of Urdu and Persian poetry. While Gondvi&rsquo;s work is minimal, as compared with the works of other Classical poets, such as Ghalib, and Mir Taqi Mir who have written thousands of verses, the quality of his work also stands out. Asghar seems to have been influenced by Ghalib, while in his emphasis on the greatness of man, and the value of struggle, he reminds us of Iqbal, who too, gives utmost importance to the virtues of love, faith and action.&nbsp;  

Asgha&rsquo;r poetic works are available in two volumes: Nishat-e-Rooh (Bliss of the Soul) and Sarud-e-Zindagi (Song of Life). The central theme of his poetry is love, not earthly and material, but mystic and transcendental. He expresses his feelings with consummate artistry, using the imagery of romantic poetry, so that he can be enjoyed at both the secular and spiritual levels. According to him life is a perpetual quest, an eternal search for the fount of love and beauty, and all objects of this earth are engaged in the pursuit of this one aim. Reason and analytical probing cannot take us to the source of light and love. What we need is a spirit of self-surrender and a sense of humility. Then alone can we rise above the apparent confusion of creeds and realise that one Truth towards which the all of creation is striving.

"Where Worlds Collide","The current generation of Pakistani writers, born after the 1971 war and now writing in the twenty-first century, must navigate between the ancient cultural legacy they have inherited and the relative youth of their country. Their nation, not yet seventy years old, born of independence and partition with the accompanying growing pains and political turmoil, is a nation nevertheless, no longer simply an idea. However important the role of M A Jinnah in carrying the idea of Pakistan forward, Pakistani writers of the new millennium are concerned with questions of identity—what it means to be Pakistani now and may mean in the near future— in very practical terms. How to speak of past trauma without corrupting the present? What is the role for Islam in the governance of such a diverse country? How best to ensure the future of the boys and girls in a proud land which is, paradoxically, both rich and poor? Where Worlds Collide is a survey of several contemporary writers, and their efforts to trace the itinerary of Pakistan into the twenty-first century.

"Intikhab: Syed Rafiq Hussain","This book provides a representative selection from the short stories of the popular Urdu short story writer Syed Rafiq Hussain.

Hussain wrote over a span of less than a decade, crafting his stories during his spells of unemployment and never accepted remuneration for any of his stories.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Zafar Ali Khan","This is a representative selection of Zafar Ali Khan&rsquo;s Urdu poetry. He was a fearless journalist, a writer of crisp prose, a political figure, and an orator who knew how to draw the crowds, Zafar Ali Khan at the same time was a poet who played with words masterfully but never neglected to convey a message. The literary gatherings and the company of scholars such as Shibli Naumani and Prof Thomas Arnold, who were among his teachers at the Aligarh University, broadened his mental horizon. Often inspired by some political incident, he would compose &mdash;rather dictate &mdash; poetry extemporaneously. Pungent satire and repartee being his weapons, he would often lampoon the politicians he did not agree with. In fact, if put in chronological order, his poems can retell the political history of the subcontinent in the 1920s, through to the 1940s, and beyond. His poetic collections are Baharistan, Nigaristan, and Chamanistan, Habsiyaat, Armughan e QaadiyanandKhamistan e Hijaz.This selection of his poems would definitely be of interest for many, including students of Urdu literature since it is a part of the syllabus in many universities.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Kishwar Naheed","This is a selection of the poems of Kishwar Naheed, who was born into a family that frowned upon higher education for girls, and where literary activity was a taboo. She rebelled on both scores, gaining higher education and acquiring celebrity as a poet and writer. Quite understandably, she became an activist for women’s liberation. This aspect of her activism, fully reflected in her poetry, became heightened during the reactionary regime of Ziaul Haq. In her formative phase, she modelled her poetry on the modern poets of her generation. Finding her metier in blank verse, Kishwar Naheed, moved on to prose poems, which she composes with unusual felicity. Kishwar Naheed has published her autobiography Buri Aurat Ki Katha and has translated Simone du Beauvoir’s The Second Sex into Urdu.

His first collection of short stories Seemia was published from Lucknow in 1984, the second Itr e Kafoor was published in 1990, the third Taoos e Chaman ki Maina in 1997, and the fourth Gunjfa is published in 2008.

"Attia Hosain: Distant Traveller","The accidental discovery of chapters from an unfinished novel and of unpublished stories made the publication of this anthology of Attia Hosain’s new and selected fiction an inevitability. Attia’s two worlds—the Lucknow she grew up in and the London she later lived and worked in—intersect and mesh in the stories and novel excerpts presented here reflecting her deep and abiding concern with those caught in the cleft stick of history and how they come to terms with it. The distinctive quality of her prose—subtle, elegant, with an uncanny ear for dialogue and sharp, yet sympathetic observation—is displayed to stunning effect as she delineates the tension and pathos of lives and societies in transition. A feast of fiction.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Bahadur Shah Zafar","This is a representative selection of Bahadur Shah Zafar's Urdu poetry. His poetry reflects not only his innate gloom and despair, which was a natural reflection of the then apparent sense of doom, but it also depicts the cultural, historical and political aspects of the society he was living in. Delhi, the great Mughal capital, had become a centre of cultural and literary activities and composing poetry was but natural for a person like Bahadur Shah Zafar who was immersed in this cultural environ. Being the king was no hindrance in the expression of his natural poetic and artistic talents. A keen sense of linguistic changes and standards, cultural nuances and innate poetic sensitivity make Zafar a remarkable poet. Of late, his works have been out of print, as well as selections of his poetry, although he is considered an important poet and at certain levels his poetry is included in curricula.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Ameer Meenai","Ameer Meenai is noteworthy for his devotional poetry, which has been represented in this volume. Hitherto, the sheer volume of his poetic works had made Meenai only partially available to a wide readership. With this selection, that barrier has been removed. Meenai’s first poetry collection was Ghairat e Baharistan, which was ready for publication but destroyed during the 1857 War of Independence. Among his published poetry collections, Miraat ul Ghaib and Sanam Khana e Ishq were popular. He also published a collection of his Persian poetry. He compiled a dictionary Ameer ul Lughaat, of which two volumes were published in 1891 and 1892 and the third in 2010.

Daybreak,"Daybreak: Writings on Faiz was initiated as a project of the Gurmani Centre for Languages and Literature at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) to mark the Faiz Ahmed Faiz centenary. The book brings together articles and essays on Faiz by British, American, Russian, Indian, and Pakistani writers along with Faiz&rsquo;s poems rendered into English by thirteen translators. Two of Faiz&rsquo;s interviews sum up the poet&rsquo;s own views on art, literature, and the artist. Ranging from purely critical writings to reminiscences and memoirs, the collection provides a comprehensive overview of the poet&rsquo;s persona, his work, and the major happenings that influenced and shaped his literary career. The book is compiled as a tribute to Faiz and will be significant because this represents the first time such diverse material in English has been collected in a single volume.

He translated into Urdu the poems of Byron, and Shelley but mostly Thomas Moore. Nadir’s original  Urdu poems stand out for their compactness and organizational brevity, which most classical Urdu poets lack because of their penchant for the ghazal, a form of poetry in which the themes of each distich are different from each other. This  selection will introduce the poetry of Nadir to a new generation of Urdu poetry lovers.

"Ma Baad Nau Aabaadiyaat","This book adequately covers the subject of the theories and practice of Post Colonialism as reflected in Urdu Literature. This topic is included in the BA (Hons.) and MA courses of Urdu Literature in Pakistan, but so far, barring a few scattered articles, there is no full-length treatment of the topic. The author’s treatment of the topic, as well as that of the colonial legacy of Urdu Literature, is of a high quality. He has convincingly argued that the essence and existence of Modernism and Conservatism ascertained by Urdu writers can be traced to the competing interpretations of the grand narrative of Europe.

"Karachi - Our Stories in Our Words","The book is a collection of stories and voices from all over Karachi, written for a story-writing competition arranged by Oxford University Press Pakistan&mdash;and is based on the idea that everyone has a good story to tell. These stories, written by many individuals separately, together chronicle the city and its life.&nbsp;  

Karachi as a cosmopolitan city of prosperity and opportunity is a strong theme&mdash;a city where people from all over the country and continent mingle and live in close proximity. There are stories of kindness and empathy. And there are themes of deep income disparity and social injustice. There is nostalgia for a time gone by in Karachi, a new awareness of its past history, a love of the beach and the sea. There is deep pain in these stories&mdash;of the loss of loved ones, of violence and murder and target killings&mdash;and a real sense of belief and hope for a better future.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Momin","Hakim Momin Khan Momin is regarded as the quintessential poet of the classical ghazal. In polished diction, he depicts abject adoration of the beloved, which was almost conventional, but beyond that his lyrics are rapturous and engaging.  Apart from romantic themes, Momin took an interest in the political upheavals of his time and made memorable comments in verse. His poetry has great variety in terms of theme and form. In this short but representative selection, a new  generation of readers will be able to access his poetry, sometimes described as the lynchpin of the Urdu Ghazal.

His poetry, although on every Urdu lover's lips, did not have the typical ingredients of popular poetry.

He composed a large number of odes which were much admired for their conceits and ornamentation. His lyrical poetry adopted the pure local idiom which was then the ideal of ghazal poets. In some of his verses, which have both the universe and love as his themes, Zauq has risen to great heights and some of his verses have become proverbial. Such a poet needs to be re-introduced to the new generation of readers, and this is what is being tried to achieve through this volume.

Atash lived in the surroundings of decadent poetry, but because of his ascetic nature he wrote mainly on spiritual themes and of the calamities befalling his age. His poetry is attractive even though he relegated romantic themes to the margins of his poetry. The diction of Atash is also remarkable, in that though it lacks the flow and facility of his contemporaries, it is attuned to reflection, in which he excels.

The individual essays contain various characters in comic situations such as a very dull student or a henpecked husband. In contrast to the riotous and ribald Urdu prose of the 1920s, Patras developed a style that was as communicative as it was restrained. The situation, the style, and the characters, removed from normalcy by only one degree. This has been a popular work, but over the years, several unauthentic versions have flooded the market. The OUP edition contains the authentic and original text, and this edition has in addition three very rare reviews in which Patras combined the functions of literary criticism and humour.

Noon Meem Rashid’s poems had vigour, and the compactness, which had eluded Urdu poetry till then. From first collection Ma’wara, 1941, Rashid comes through as a sceptic with deep metaphysical insight. Noon Meem Rashid’s blank verses were full abstract illuminations and formations, projecting the enigmatic, bizarre, and weird aspects of life, absorbing into poetry themes that had hitherto been the presence of prose.

While, on one level, his poems can be read as uninhibited love poetry, Jigar had a transcendental style and a natural bent toward Sufism which caused his poems to be read as esoteric verse.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Shaad Azeemabadi","This book contains a selection from the poems of Shaad Azeemabadi who was responsible, firstly, for the revival of Urdu ghazal, and, secondly, for giving an ideological basis to the Urdu elegy. In Shaad, the creative impulse was stronger  than critical insight. Shaad wrote of requited love in a more respectable setting. The lyrical abandon found in his poems is yet to be equalled.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Nazir Akbarabadi","This selection contains the best poems of Nazir Akbarabadi, a poet unique in the tradition of Urdu poetry. While mainstream Urdu poets favoured the ghazal or masnavi, poetic forms having their origin in the Middle East, Nazir Akbarabadi  wrote continuous and coherent poems, drawing upon the Indian locale for his themes. Being an exponent of nature, festivals, and the common folk, Nazir Akbarabadi was hailed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century as one  of the foremost poets of Urdu.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Hasrat Mohani","This is a selection of the ghazals of Hasrat Mohani, who was a firebrand revolutionary, an ascetic by character, and an ardent lover as a poet. His diction was traditional, but the context of his love lyrics was not. Firstly, he expressed  love not for courtesans but domestic love. Secondly, he wrote of requited love, not pathetic love. His lyrics have political overtones, as his long imprisonments creep in as poetical allusions. Hasrat, even in his lifetime, was a legendary and  popular poet.

The ghazal idiom enables his poetry to be read at both a worldly and spiritual level, which is why the readership is so extensive.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Mir Taqi Mir Second Edition","This book contains selected ghazals of Mir Taqi Mir (1723–1810) who was the defining poet of classical Urdu poetry. His ghazals were celebrated for their utter simplicity and pathos, and his verses exemplifying the ideal suffering lover created a prototype that all masters of Urdu poetry aspired to but never achieved. Mir, thus, became the poets’ poet. This slim volume of his selected poetry is designed to make the poets’ poet, the people’s poet as well.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Allama Iqbal","This book contains a selection from the poems of Allama Iqbal,the first Urdu poet credited with a systematic philosophy, i.e. Khudi which means self-awareness or loftiness of character. His poetry inspired many generations, both before and after Independence, since infinite struggle was his ideal. Iqbal struck a responsive chord in his readers, more than any lyrical poet has been able to strike. His style is better described as scriptural rather than as the grand style usually employed in religious themes.

"The Genesis of the Pakistan Idea","The main purpose of this study is to trace the course of Hindu–Muslim relations in India, from the Lucknow Pact of 1916 to the demand for Pakistan made by the All-India Muslim League in 1940. The basic features of the evolving Hindu–Muslim relations, beginning from a description of the differences in culture between the two communities, are sketched. These comprise the establishment of a unitary government by the British East India Company and the British government, the rise of nationalism as a result of the cultural renaissance in the nineteenth century, and the struggle for constitutional reform that ended with Partition in 1947.  From 1906, at which time the Hindus and Muslims were separately organized, until shortly before Partition, the Hindus, Muslims, and the British government hoped for a communal agreement. This led to proposals for a federation, on the basis that would best suit the type of plural society that existed in India. Negotiations between Hindus and Muslims broke down because the former demanded agreement before the discussion of a constitution whereas the latter considered the constitution as a means of bringing about agreement.  The situation was such that the British government could make use of the policy of divide et impera, regardless of whether or not it did so deliberately. Accusations were made which encouraged and deepened the communal rift, in order to continue Britain’s control over India. At any rate, in the end, the only solution to the problem of plural societies in India proved to be Partition.

"A Political History of Pakistan, 1947-2007","This book describes the political history of Pakistan from the time of Partition to the Musharraf government. In considerable detail, the authors have described the main features and predominant trends. The aims and achievements of the successive governments are analyzed, with particular attention to the interplay of socio-economic forces and interests. The country’s foreign policy is examined in the context of the regional and global situation, with special regard to the relations between Pakistan and the USSR/Russia.             This is a serious, scholarly narrative regarding the life of the nation.  The seven chapters of the book correspond to a specific historical period.  The first chapter deals with the struggle for the creation of the new state and the forces driving its emergence.  The second chapter analyzes the formative years up to the military coup of 1958, while the third describes in detail the internal and foreign policy of the Ayub Khan administration. In the fourth chapter, the authors single out specific features of the Z.A. Bhutto administration (1971–1977), and in the fifth they deal with the long rule of General Ziaul Haq. The sixth chapter relates to the study of the 1988–1999 democratic interregnum. The last chapter details the policies during General Pervez Musharraf’s rule of the country.

"The Culture of Power and Governance of Pakistan 1947-2008","This book attempts to explain Pakistan’s crisis of governance in historical and philosophical terms. It argues that South Asia’s indigenous orientation towards the exercise of power has reasserted itself and produced a regression in the behaviour of the ruling elite. This has meant that in the sixty years of independence from British rule the behaviour of the state apparatus and political class has become more arbitrary, proprietorial and delusional. The resulting deterioration in the intellectual and moral quality of the state apparatus is a mortal threat to Pakistan. Regrettably, much of the academic and public discussion about developing societies has been vitiated by the heedless repetition of fashionable jargon that emphasizes national security, democracy and development. The Culture of Power and Governance of Pakistan draws upon the primary declassified record of Pakistan and a diverse array of theoretical inputs to try and balance the debate on the crisis of governance.
Author Description  Ilhan Niaz is Assistant Professor of History at the Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan.  He is the author of An Inquiry into the Culture of Power of the Subcontinent (Alhamra, 2006), and has been published regularly in academic journals and newspapers.     ‘It is a splendid work based on a tremendous amount of original sources...a contribution of enduring value to the literature on governmental institutions in Pakistan.’   – Anwar Syed, Professor Emeritus of Political Science, University of Massachusetts, USA  ‘This is a provocative, but strongly argued analysis. It rests not just on a close reading of secondary sources, but the use of a range of declassified records which are held at the National Documentation Centre in Islamabad...The other thing which marks it out is the originality of the conceptual framework and the ease with which the author moves from broad historical comparison to detailed examination of administrative and economic policy and attitudinal surveys. This is a blending of historical and social science analysis at its best.’   – Ian Talbot, Professor of History, University of Southampton, UK  ‘. . . this volume itself, and the author . . . offer powerful evidence that while Pakistan may be in trouble, it cannot be ignored. Its army is not fading away as the bureaucracy did, and positively Pakistan is still capable of producing scholars who write first-rate books. . . . So, while much of it makes depressing reading, the existence of this Pakistan-educated scholar, active in the press as well as the classroom, is a heartening data point.’  – Stephen P. Cohen, Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy Studies Brookings Institution,   Washington, DC

"Tasveeri Kahani Silsila: Allama Iqbal","Graphic Stories are a popular genre of writing in English as well as in many other languages, and popular in many countries. However, there were no locally produced graphic stories in Pakistan in English, Urdu, or any of the regional languages before the publication of&nbsp;Abdul Sattar Edhi.&nbsp;The rich pictorial presentation of text in this genre is fascinating for children, and effective in attracting reluctant readers to the world of books.  

This graphic novel narrates the story of Pakistan&rsquo;s national poet Dr Allama Iqbal. He is considered one of the most important figures in Urdu literature. The book covers the many facets of his personality&mdash;that of writer, barrister, philosopher, and leader. It recounts his political ideology, his vision of Pakistan, and the role his poems and writings played in the awakening of Muslims in the subcontinent.

"Intikhab-e-Kalam: Shibli Naumani","This is a representative selection of Shibli Nomani&rsquo;s Urdu poetry.Shibli started writing poetry in his childhood. He was a prolific writer of both prose and poetry in Urdu. His poetry, both in Persian and Urdu, was of a very high order and served as an important medium through which Shibli expressed his political thoughts. In Islamic societies, Poetry has always been a powerful means of expressing political sentiments, and it continues to be a strong emotive force in modern South Asia.  

Shibli&rsquo;s poems were often scathing criticisms of the All India Muslim League, employing sharp and exquisite irony by contrasting familiar League slogans with their supine behaviour. The study of these poems offers a vivid picture of the early days of the Muslim League. Keeping in view its policies, no one could predict that this organization would one day manage to create a separate homeland for Indian Muslims.
